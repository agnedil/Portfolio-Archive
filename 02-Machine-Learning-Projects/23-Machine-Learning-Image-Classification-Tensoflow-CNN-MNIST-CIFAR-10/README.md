# TensoFlow CNN Clasifiers for MNIST and CIFAR-10 Datasets

Convolutional neural networks: Tensorflow is an environment for building, among other things, neural networks. You can build multilayer networks; convolutional layers; and residual networks using tensorflow. There is a tool called tensorboard, which will display the progress of learning

1. Installing Tensorflow and going through the MNIST tutorial at https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/estimators/cnn, tensorboard tutorial at https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/summaries_and_tensorboard.

* Inserting appropriate lines of code into the tensorflow example to log the accuracy on tensorboard every 100 batches, for at least 2000 batches, screen capturing the accuracy graph from tensorboard.

* Modifying the architecture that is offered in the MNIST tutorial to get the best accuracy possible.

2. Going through the CIFAR-10 tutorial at https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/deep_cnn and running the code, inserting appropriate lines of code to log the accuracy on tensorboard every 100 batches, for at least 2000 batches, and then modifying the architecture to get the best accuracy possible. Anything better than about 93.5% will be comparable with current research
