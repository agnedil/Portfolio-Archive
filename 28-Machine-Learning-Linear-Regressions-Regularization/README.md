# Linear Regression

1. Dataset: http://www.statsci.org/data/general/brunhild.html, measures the concentration of a sulfate in the blood as a function of time. Building a linear regression of the log of the concentration against the log of time.

2. Dataset: http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/physical.html,contains measurements of body mass and various diameters. Building a linear regression of predicting the body
mass from these diameters.

3. Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone, contains measurements of blacklip abalone (Haliotis rubra) of various ages and genders. Building a linear regressions predicting the age from the measurements ignoring gender, the age from the measurements including gender, the log of age from the measurements, ignoring gender, the log age from the measurements including gender and improving these regressions by using a regularizer, using glmnet to obtain plots of the cross-validated prediction error.
