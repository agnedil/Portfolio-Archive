# NLP - Metapy Text Classifiers (Python)

Building inverted and forward indices from a text corpus and using NaiveBayes, KNN, SVM_SGD_OneVsAll, DualPerceptron, and Linear Winnow classifiers from the metapy Python module to train the model and test it on unseen Twitter data while adjusting classifier parameters for the best performance.

Metapy is a Python wrapper for the MeTa toolkit. MeTA is a modern data sciences toolkit featuring:

   - Text tokenization, including deep semantic features like parse trees;

   - Inverted and forward indexes with compression and various caching strategies;

   - A collection of ranking functions for searching the indexes;

   - Topic models;

   - Classification algorithms;

   - Graph algorithms;

   - Language models;

   - CRF implementation (POS-tagging, shallow parsing);

   - Wrappers for liblinear and libsvm (including libsvm dataset parsers);

   - UTF8 support for analysis on various languages;

   - Multithreaded algorithms.
