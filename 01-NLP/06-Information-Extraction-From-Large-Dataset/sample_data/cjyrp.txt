    IRRITATING TO EYES OF RABBITS; NON-IRRITATING TO SKIN OF RABBITS.
    HUMAN PATCH TESTS INCIDATE	THAT MATL IS SKIN SENSITIZER. MUTAGENIC
    SCREENING - NO MUTAGENIC ACITVITY WAS OBSERVED IN AMES TEST, E COLI
    WP2 UVRA/CHO CHROMOSOME ABERRATION ASSASY. A DOMINANT-LETHAL TEST
    PERFORMED W/RATS WAS NEG.  MUTAGENIC RESPONSES WERE OBSERVED IN E
    COLI POL A+/A- (W/PREINCUBATION), MOUSE LYMPHOMA L5178YTK+- & CELL
    TRANSFORMATION BALB/3T3 ASSAYS. (ECOLOGICAL INFO)

=====================  Ecological Information  =====================

Ecological:TOXICITY INFO: CHRONIC TOX/CARCINOGENICITY - GROUPS OF RATS
    WERE ADMIN OBTS OF 0, 5, 50 & 400 MG/KG/DAY OVER 113 WK PERIOD.
    CHANGES WERE THOSE COMMONLY SEEN IN AGING RATS OF STRAIN USED.
    THERE WAS NO  PATTERN OF MICROSCOPIC LESIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR
    APPARENT INCR IN EARLY MORTALITY IN SOME TREATMENT GROUPS, WHICH
    WAS ATTRIBUTED TO CHANCE RATHER THAN TREATMENT W/OBTS. MALE &
    FEMALE RATS GIVEN HIGH & ME DIUM DOSES GAINED LESS WEIGHT THAN
    CONTROLS THROUGHOUT STUDY. LOW DOSE FEMALES SHOWED SM REDUCTION IN
    WEIGHT GAIN, SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH IS DOUBTFUL. (TRANSPORT INFO)

====================  Disposal Considerations  ====================

Waste Disposal Methods:NOT A RCRA HAZARDOUS WASTE. INCINERATE OR
    DISPOSE IN LANDFILL ACCORDING TO APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL

    INFO: THE REDUCED WEIGHT GAIN WAS ASSOC W/REDUCED FOOD CONSUMPTION.
    SLIGHT CHANGES WERE SEEN IN ABSOLUTE & RELATIVE WEIGHTS OF CERTAIN
    ORGANS AT MECROPSY.  CHANGES IN KIDNEY & LIVER WEIGHT SUGGEST
    SLIGHT RESPONSE TO TREATMENT, WHILE CHANGES IN OTHER ORGANS REFLECT
    INTERFERENCE WITH NORMAL GROWTH PATTERNS. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF
    ANY TREATMENT RELATED E FT ON INCIDENCE & CAUSES OF MORBIDITY OR
