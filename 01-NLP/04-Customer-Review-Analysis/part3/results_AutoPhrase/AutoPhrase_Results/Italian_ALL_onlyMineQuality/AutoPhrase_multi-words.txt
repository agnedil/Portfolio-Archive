0.0572397914	she passed
0.0572380575	her entree
0.0572354544	as evidenced by

0.0572139045	already packed
0.0572114843	the saltiness

0.0571907173	of a mall
0.0571900982	it's clear
0.0571899995	medium rare and it was
0.0571884711	have seen

0.0571834901	both were outstanding
0.0571777822	more subtle
0.0571715965	in no rush
0.0571709983	and were pleasantly surprised
0.0571693698	coming back again and again
0.0571657708	in my case
0.0571643351	if you enjoy
0.0571625284	they use real
0.0571613911	like a rock

0.0571137942	that the meat
0.0571137942	that the cheese
0.0571137942	was the prosciutto
0.0571137942	was the wrong

0.0570624356	knowing how
0.0570578288	money and time
0.0570545446	the waitress was
0.0570533381	not the worst
0.0570522768	considering the fact
0.0570504237	go back to
0.0570496407	was sparse
0.0570459976	about how
0.0570457591	a local pizza
0.0570402647	there was so much
0.0570382540	throw some
0.0570338544	been a while since

0.0570079806	out of the kitchen
0.0570079806	one of the servers
0.0570079806	can be a bit
0.0570070554	stickler for

0.0569713911	so was the service
0.0569713289	probably the worst
0.0569689013	so it worked
0.0569685809	promised to
0.0569681882	different experiences
0.0569617698	waited and waited and

0.0568864033	few seats
0.0568859718	some co workers

0.0568671878	come over and
0.0568671878	i just couldn't
0.0568665219	if you can't decide
0.0568649578	of flavor
0.0568632702	we ended up waiting
0.0568599306	asked her if
0.0568591153	was flavorless
0.0568589495	break your
0.0568569121	ever been served
0.0568502738	every last drop of
0.0568486404	the kinks

0.0568396615	couldn't find anything
0.0568379165	a few days before
0.0568201380	how things were
0.0568183356	first two times
0.0568180113	the manager or owner
0.0568178889	on a lunch break
0.0568145524	an urban
0.0568142933	will have to
0.0568097467	the home made pasta
0.0568078288	remember the last time i
0.0568063555	for a great price

0.0568056759	that they serve
0.0568047245	are all great
0.0568013185	considered a
0.0567957640	i'll be going back
0.0567953148	all over
0.0567902647	i never would have
0.0567902647	in and of itself
0.0567862003	be a regular stop
0.0567852337	has nothing to do with
0.0567845006	complained that
0.0567834101	or even
0.0567797603	will likely
0.0567676342	was really
0.0567645710	realized it was
0.0567636401	single one
0.0567630372	have enough room
0.0567623470	by bringing
0.0567621365	his establishment
0.0567593178	three hour
0.0567575149	her if she
0.0567547206	a nice local
0.0567536558	3 other tables
0.0567512537	server brought out
0.0567503979	was ecstatic

0.0567501874	that's where
0.0567469786	of pizza places
0.0567448130	chef who

0.0567384646	a favourite
0.0567367933	offense to
0.0567336243	rushed out
0.0567326805	is just awesome
0.0567288790	open yet
0.0567277543	of this chain
0.0567247671	definitely worth a visit
0.0567206202	we were staying at the palazzo
0.0567202736	the other side of the restaurant
0.0567187988	send it
0.0567178197	being in a strip mall
0.0567171878	my only complaint was that
0.0567151336	a 2nd
0.0567114797	return again
0.0567093914	min to get
0.0567085691	suspect that
0.0567066334	want something different
0.0567058780	bit slow but
0.0567058501	40 minutes later
0.0567048108	wish they could
0.0567005391	i stayed
0.0567005211	as seen on
0.0566937177	tatum and
0.0566932220	is this good
0.0566930720	min after
0.0566907173	of our pizzas
0.0566871990	was decently
0.0566857102	too heavily
0.0566847715	bit high but
0.0566841276	can you tell
0.0566823327	during my last visit
0.0566803937	of the sort
0.0566777490	delay and
0.0566761872	bustle of
0.0566756254	was very pleasant
0.0566733964	these pizzas
0.0566730025	in the freezer
0.0566721015	other veggies

0.0341729822	a lot of options
0.0341725427	never go back
0.0341725062	the waiters and waitresses

0.0341549118	in the late
0.0341485590	try other items
0.0341458181	i would absolutely
0.0341414351	to reserve a
0.0341413328	had a good
0.0341411797	almost 15 minutes

0.0341403930	decided to take a
0.0341403930	bring it out to
0.0341357365	let the outside
0.0341295636	no idea about

0.0329637451	by this time
0.0329616557	had to wait an hour
0.0329603270	it was incredible
0.0329584519	leftovers to take
0.0329569313	the place was empty
0.0329548219	for a business
0.0329502234	large amount of
0.0329485531	both agreed that
0.0329446663	is my all time favorite
0.0329438850	which is weird
0.0329411033	every need
0.0329344295	able to serve
0.0329324985	was a bit of a disappointment
0.0329315307	for the both of us

0.0329296548	in northern
0.0329286025	best pizza i have ever eaten

0.0329112460	easily one of the best

0.0328899407	i'm not even sure
0.0328895755	was so tender
0.0328892070	but i feel
0.0328874797	it did not disappoint
0.0328852419	after eating here
0.0328833361	remember why
0.0328779770	the service was spot on
0.0328719374	our group of 6
0.0328665718	definitely worth the wait
0.0328641471	portion size of the
0.0328634547	but that doesn't mean
0.0328597964	before our entrees
0.0328526742	don't get it
0.0328519634	i will surely
0.0328481646	saved by

0.0327278418	the staff is nice

0.0305381905	being a vegetarian
0.0305354404	also tried their
0.0305334013	the south side of
0.0305284692	of the bellagio
0.0305272241	you won't see
0.0305262839	to go cup
0.0305259310	within a couple
0.0305254972	our waiter was extremely
0.0305245953	asking us if
0.0305232538	the guys behind the counter
0.0305228036	see how we were doing
0.0305201451	with the purchase of
0.0305176415	pizza places in the
0.0305176415	ordered the bruschetta and

0.0304922649	the portions are small

0.0304811726	nice change from the
0.0304787887	one of our friends
0.0304785558	was deliciously
0.0304769093	sauce was watery and
0.0304744364	came out fast
0.0304741681	we were waited on by
0.0304717951	under the table
0.0304699929	pair with the
0.0304679626	of their pies
0.0304650820	under 10

0.0304592427	when i picked it up
0.0304572054	that they have
0.0304564455	but i felt
0.0304543570	i love their pizza
0.0304541763	a lot of pride in
0.0304536807	the veggies were fresh
0.0304530570	to wait an hour
0.0304512954	it was raw
0.0304497988	the flatbread was

0.0303864618	a little oily
0.0303863903	on our next visit

0.0245329860	wait for your
0.0245316857	their pastas are
0.0245308317	tiramisu i've ever had

0.0244893415	such a fan
0.0244878145	the parking situation is

0.0244630843	i typically get
0.0244585698	we could share
0.0244576557	over 5 minutes
0.0244568054	a couple of slices

0.0230745559	to seat you
0.0230744801	the outside tables

0.0229786705	that they would

0.0221408347	will probably be
0.0221387779	course meal for $
0.0221360336	too good to be
0.0221355593	back for more
0.0221338966	almost as good as

0.0221336221	i can handle
0.0221333620	about this place so we

0.0221233921	for over 25
0.0221225502	the heck out

0.0221091650	a mixture of
0.0221091650	to grab a
0.0221081823	we ordered a margherita
0.0221051204	for those looking for

0.0220950089	carnevino is a
0.0220946043	agreed that it was
0.0220942399	are a little steep
0.0220940926	times already

0.0220887695	excellent as well as
0.0220864414	drinks were also
0.0220862451	on a friday night and the
0.0220858608	it's obvious that

0.0220728839	is so bad
0.0220722212	this place is perfect
0.0220706153	everything was fine
0.0220687931	what happened to
0.0220684514	it was one of the
0.0220684267	not an easy
0.0220639117	we were the only people
0.0220639117	we decided to get the
0.0220638673	and they were great
0.0220630843	i thoroughly enjoyed my
0.0220618548	last night and had
0.0220585826	which were very good
0.0220585826	for each of us
0.0220575475	7 course
0.0220575274	would most likely
0.0220555935	you know how
0.0220555935	i don't want
0.0220549937	server to come
0.0220549536	to mop up

0.0220504237	there were some
0.0220477686	great place to go and
0.0220457006	is mediocre at best
0.0220436261	for an upscale
0.0220425360	the paninis are
0.0220400518	took forever for
0.0220395150	can't remember which
0.0220368117	didn't know what to do
0.0220360668	if you choose
0.0220353884	and waited and waited
0.0220328530	can deal with
0.0220325941	we have eaten here

0.0220293845	i like the food
0.0220249941	both were pretty
0.0220230597	i am addicted to
0.0220226792	of the negative
0.0220203371	we wanted to try
0.0220201485	place with a
0.0220201451	far and away the best
0.0220190584	is essentially a
0.0220190102	to the door
0.0220185846	1 star because
0.0220179531	a very intimate
0.0220173165	didn't like it
0.0220168095	like to sit

0.0219784751	sandwich i've had
0.0219758263	main course i had
0.0219737669	pasta and it was
0.0219737296	the ambiance of the restaurant

0.0219717951	had to send
0.0219710908	you want me to do

0.0219625096	try them out
0.0219624562	bread and it was
0.0219585509	not to mention the fact that

0.0219569313	the first time we went
0.0219549767	entree came with
0.0219537575	not sure what's
0.0219523894	have never seen

0.0218164566	learned that they
0.0218157228	the food is simply

0.0218091172	of about 10
0.0218084013	didn't really know what
0.0218050238	enough to make up for
0.0218027002	and was topped with
0.0218026593	i'm giving it
0.0218013497	amazed at the
0.0217997988	each time we go

0.0217918722	the bathrooms were
0.0217899608	was tender and
0.0217899608	i didn't have
0.0217899608	the fact that they
0.0217884043	their ability to
0.0217869060	it did seem
0.0217838012	don't believe me
0.0217824909	was a combination
0.0217824909	had a caesar
0.0217809631	the weight of

0.0217701451	too much for what
0.0217701451	me that she
0.0217695525	and i highly recommend the
0.0217679694	is on the table

0.0212360210	that i had to
0.0212360210	it is the best
0.0212354670	the same things
0.0212350828	we waited for a table
0.0212342560	and this place is the
0.0212342560	and i thought they
0.0212342560	and fresh and the
0.0212342560	this place because the
0.0212342560	the patio and the
0.0212342560	and creamy and the
0.0212342560	the pizza here was
0.0212342560	the sauce had no
0.0212342560	i took one
0.0212342560	we ordered was the
0.0212342560	the strip and the
0.0212342560	it might be a
0.0212342560	the experience and the
0.0212311829	was a bit much
0.0212307753	wasn't so bad
0.0212233804	we are going
0.0212216555	it becomes
0.0212213923	that they charge
0.0212213276	she was extremely
0.0212182559	it should have been
0.0212165842	right in the middle of
0.0212165842	my first time at
0.0212162619	favorites were the
0.0212152326	the food is pretty
0.0212149628	have been disappointed
0.0212131153	i can't stop
0.0212108892	not out of this world
0.0212102851	better if they
0.0212102851	a show at
0.0212099769	as a local
0.0212088955	the longest time
0.0212081233	to bring us
0.0212079090	was hot and delicious
0.0212047422	what appears to
0.0212019389	i really like the
0.0212019389	the size of the
0.0212019389	we split the
0.0212008775	a second glass
0.0212006587	he was able
0.0211990251	i feel that
0.0211950276	a nice addition to
0.0211932220	for about the same
0.0211923119	surprised that they
0.0211917951	on the grill
0.0211898060	partial to the
0.0211882755	the grocery store and
0.0211859132	and i were
0.0211852851	could go on
0.0211826987	pizza is one of
0.0211825988	the food was very
0.0211825988	i was actually
0.0211804446	by far the most
0.0211798275	great to have a
0.0211784021	would expect from an
0.0211775527	go straight to
0.0211766869	waited a good
0.0211759641	too full to eat
0.0211755546	service was very good and the
0.0211753771	still thinking about
0.0211739422	food to come
0.0211713257	we were totally
0.0211703339	lunch one day and
0.0211702782	looked around and
0.0211679165	got the caesar
0.0211679165	to wait 30
0.0211665042	in my humble
0.0211643199	start by saying i
0.0211628413	bread they use
0.0211617446	when i pulled
0.0211613911	you are expecting
0.0211602722	and it was really good
0.0211602722	and they were all
0.0211602722	we enjoyed the
0.0211601247	food is pretty good and
0.0211600819	next to the restaurant
0.0211558703	but i'd rather
0.0211553603	the least expensive
0.0211541400	than i'm used to
0.0211541094	that the majority
0.0211526136	tried several
0.0211525866	place was packed with
0.0211503633	at a pizza place
0.0211496771	find a decent
0.0211489592	a nice variety of
0.0211485698	were very accommodating
0.0211474967	it looked and smelled
0.0211472450	that came out was
0.0211472450	i came to this
0.0211472450	is that you have
0.0211472450	it so much that
0.0211472450	to go out for
0.0211472450	it was like i
0.0211472450	i had on my
0.0211472450	you do that
0.0211472450	it down with
0.0211472450	it to be the best
0.0211472450	we always have a
0.0211472450	out of their way
0.0211472450	to get back there
0.0211472450	is not for you
0.0211472450	had to be at
0.0211472450	was getting a
0.0211472450	is only a
0.0211472450	is sure to
0.0211466259	such a huge
0.0211464547	better than this place
0.0211462020	were just ok
0.0211458535	but i suspect
0.0211453269	at the bar and enjoyed
0.0211447241	don't miss out
0.0211413328	we opted for the
0.0211413328	you will not
0.0211408347	when i finally got
0.0211408347	it seems as if
0.0211389270	wish i had ordered

0.0209132884	got a caesar
0.0209130089	the ambiance is perfect
0.0209108608	rather than later
0.0209072472	a lot more than
0.0209063723	because it takes

0.0207356872	food was not good
0.0207347276	asking about

0.0207338434	more than 2
0.0207304609	times in the past and
0.0207299948	didn't even bother to
0.0207279635	my main dish was
0.0207235924	things about this place and
0.0207220300	had a nice crust
0.0207205686	i would pay
0.0207189107	highlight of this
0.0207180564	with my girlfriends
0.0207168371	have a bigger

0.0207062090	the view and the
0.0207062090	was decent but the
0.0207062090	the start of the
0.0207062090	the owners of this
0.0207062090	was in the area and

0.0207062090	the food wasn't that
0.0207062090	and i'm not even

0.0206932220	but our service was
0.0206932220	in after us

0.0200203371	the best part was the

0.0199921752	due to its
0.0199904336	food is good but

0.0183043625	this place did not disappoint
0.0183027002	and the service has always been
0.0182999365	time i was there
0.0182999365	what i was looking for
0.0182995849	wish we would have
0.0182995849	1 star for the
0.0182990260	can take advantage of
0.0182988179	thing about this
0.0182981116	like a frozen
0.0182971830	disappointed in my
0.0182957896	sauce on the side and
0.0182947848	they didnt have
0.0182930170	served with a side
0.0182904190	that didn't stop
0.0182893599	if we could sit
0.0182889337	a little pricey but
0.0182886322	booths and a
0.0182886322	served by a
0.0182886322	chairs and a
0.0182851086	a little shopping
0.0182849106	my guests were
0.0182834075	we took a seat
0.0182827107	served before the
0.0182815536	the salad was crisp
0.0182808660	seated on the
0.0182808660	shrimp on a
0.0182808660	prepared in the
0.0182808660	rest of the
0.0182800555	is not very big
0.0182798204	need to try this place
0.0182776877	for the rest of the
0.0182775274	the most important part
0.0182770934	if you can't find
0.0182763392	about $ 5
0.0182755497	the best pizza place
0.0182750621	but it's true
0.0182744408	to our seats
0.0182739934	they are using
0.0182721484	before we arrived
0.0182672333	can't get any
0.0182654254	know what else
0.0182648143	crazy about it
0.0182645518	is a place that i
0.0182642986	i was in love
0.0182639920	i can no longer
0.0182613911	i could understand
0.0182613773	he did a great job
0.0182595219	he was right
0.0182595219	we will never
0.0182556559	i was craving italian
0.0182530390	eat here at least
0.0182529770	the bread was fresh and
0.0182528458	only complaint was that
0.0182502366	in a quiet
0.0182487251	to enjoy a meal
0.0182481974	ever been to
0.0182476080	tried the meatball
0.0182471390	so i'll keep
0.0182462706	it is not worth
0.0182435815	i had the margherita pizza
0.0182432049	was full of
0.0182432049	but it was a little
0.0182413401	not being able to
0.0182413401	to play with
0.0182409021	i ordered the caprese
0.0182398403	parm and it was
0.0182391360	with some nice
0.0182379626	i feel sorry for
0.0182368029	fine but nothing
0.0182360210	with a couple of
0.0182351121	have done better
0.0182343658	went to this location
0.0182342560	it was made in
0.0182342560	but what can
0.0182342560	and it could have
0.0182342560	is still one of
0.0182342560	was in vegas for
0.0182342560	when our table was
0.0182342560	and had the right
0.0182342560	of the people that
0.0182342560	so if you're a
0.0182342560	the side of a
0.0182342560	and best of
0.0182342560	are still a
0.0182342560	is definitely one
0.0182339163	if we'd like
0.0182332469	served at a
0.0182328636	menu with lots of
0.0182304053	definitely a great place
0.0182300986	the only disappointment
0.0182297958	am a fan
0.0182280262	rest of our
0.0182280021	ever had anywhere
0.0182272626	buddy and i
0.0182253334	by far my favorite pizza
0.0182231737	salad is really good
0.0182231737	thought it was too
0.0182231737	atmosphere was a little
0.0182231737	friends and i had
0.0182184557	easy for me
0.0182182559	i tried their
0.0182172756	i was headed
0.0182168798	but not overly so
0.0182167344	as other reviewers have
0.0182147926	place to be
0.0182142423	to review this place
0.0182131153	i can barely
0.0182129566	me from going back
0.0182123416	he apologized and
0.0182099769	of old vegas
0.0182093923	never had anything
0.0182085509	so i thought i'd
0.0182081233	to sit at
0.0182081233	the menu isn't
0.0182077368	get our drinks
0.0182046533	the other table

0.0181932220	to make me a
0.0181932220	over to our
0.0181932220	like it came
0.0181932220	to get me to
0.0181932220	but at least it
0.0181932220	out of there for
0.0181932220	to the side of

0.0172808660	prepared for a
0.0172808660	expected for a

0.0172776877	comes with a
0.0172772792	spot to take

0.0152019389	in addition to the
0.0152009227	have to remember to

0.0151838146	this is authentic italian
0.0151828928	to get the manager
0.0151825988	my wife and i have
0.0151825988	the only thing that was
0.0151825988	my wife and i had
0.0151825988	to make up for the
0.0151825988	seems to be a
0.0151825988	is one of those
0.0151825988	i did not like
0.0151825988	i gave it
0.0151825988	all of which
0.0151825988	so we decided to try
0.0151825988	but this one is
0.0151825988	i also got the
0.0151825988	a few of the
0.0151825988	a bit on the
0.0151825988	never had a
0.0151796004	the food is consistently good
0.0151775617	i had the tiramisu
0.0151774527	describe them
0.0151767608	would probably come back
0.0151761446	i would pass on
0.0151744408	it wasn't anything special
0.0151717862	a bit heavy on the
0.0151715613	i'll skip the
0.0151707518	eaten at other
0.0151683495	that we were celebrating
0.0151669738	my friend got the
0.0151653245	i am not the biggest
0.0151650757	i'll never go
0.0151646550	was a total
0.0151644170	and it is always
0.0151644170	but the taste was
0.0151644170	the highlight of the
0.0151633180	a good mix
0.0151625739	i wish i could say
0.0151625739	next time i will try
0.0151625676	wait to try it
0.0151625676	night and we were
0.0151616385	go to an italian restaurant
0.0151610475	of the food and service
0.0151601177	for a friend's
0.0151601177	is a complete
0.0151601177	with the correct
0.0151601177	is always fresh
0.0151570159	flavor was so
0.0151541794	go back and try more
0.0151531387	i would recommend trying
0.0151529878	as it gets
0.0151522385	one of the salads
0.0151508318	we used to love
0.0151508318	keep up the great

0.0151499927	with the nutella
0.0151497631	and the food and service
0.0151495903	a bottle of wine and bruschetta
0.0151471446	you have a chance
0.0151413328	for those that
0.0151408347	nothing to do with
0.0151398165	best italian i've had in
0.0151385262	i can honestly say that
0.0151356939	either of those
0.0151343696	the cheese pizza and
0.0151341028	so you can enjoy
0.0151338966	i've had much better
0.0151338031	if you are in vegas
0.0151311990	is a great choice
0.0151303228	we had decided
0.0151303150	that i could barely
0.0151277323	i ordered the sausage
0.0151276724	on the sauce
0.0151259097	4 year
0.0151237067	with a rich
0.0151237067	it was fairly
0.0151228594	just didn't seem
0.0151226609	one of the main
0.0151222162	been coming here
0.0151205986	and the service and food
0.0151203355	to check this place out
0.0151161118	allow us
0.0151161118	keeps us
0.0151156213	came to this place
0.0151154083	who seemed
0.0151137644	in a neighborhood
0.0151123723	don't see
0.0151119408	for about 15 minutes
0.0151098887	last time we were there
0.0151097448	for a free pizza
0.0151087189	so i opted
0.0151086749	every time i eat
0.0151074909	of the shop
0.0151074909	had a cocktail
0.0151030021	be described
0.0151026342	back to the table
0.0151026342	was the only place
0.0151012530	my meal was
0.0151009534	might go back
0.0151000792	and the ambiance was nice
0.0150989055	i called them
0.0150972602	they seem to be
0.0150971315	and the atmosphere is great
0.0150968596	i can't help but
0.0150968596	down the street from
0.0150967702	always wanted to try this place
0.0150955826	i will start
0.0150955826	get a sandwich
0.0150952006	any better than
0.0150950089	expect a little
0.0150926042	who knows me
0.0150916897	that came with it was
0.0150916897	was a little on the
0.0150901952	a little soft
0.0150894442	my wife and i had dinner
0.0150861084	i am in the area
0.0150856508	my entree was the
0.0150831947	was a server
0.0150831947	it's a bar
0.0150817381	a small place and
0.0150812945	$ 20 for a bottle
0.0150777656	didn't check on
0.0150766732	this has become my
0.0150739087	which is the reason
0.0150738951	just enough sauce
0.0150738757	they weren't even
0.0150735079	i did like the
0.0150704838	go wrong with any
0.0150698563	seems to be pretty
0.0150692537	for an italian place
0.0150690205	wait to get back to
0.0150680291	would be right out
0.0150680291	made it hard to

0.0150571797	back to the restaurant
0.0150556939	he didn't want
0.0150543253	a glass of wine and
0.0150538861	was dead on
0.0150538585	a small amount
0.0150535439	through the restaurant
0.0150523049	to dine with
0.0150504237	just as good as
0.0150491392	nothing compared to
0.0150443804	i don't care how

0.0150437212	for my meal i
0.0150432214	job with the

0.0148755830	you cannot get

0.0142808660	service is better
0.0142786019	the owner came
0.0142776877	the food was really
0.0142776877	not only was
0.0142770544	it took another
0.0142755097	if i want to
0.0142750070	didn't have room for
0.0142738227	a little pricey for
0.0142705368	of the sandwich
0.0142686744	of the road
0.0142684618	my only regret is
0.0142662754	a very memorable
0.0142658242	in the brick
0.0142647676	i had a pizza
0.0142633945	any other place
0.0142633945	from the counter
0.0142607956	3 slices of
0.0142597162	best thing about
0.0142595219	really liked it
0.0142595219	the perfect amount of
0.0142595219	my daughter had the
0.0142584075	i had the cannelloni
0.0142578075	with their homemade
0.0142557072	sat us at
0.0142532939	almost everything on
0.0142527028	with the food and service
0.0142525391	of people waiting
0.0142522623	else to say
0.0142509043	and the service was pretty
0.0142504926	on a trip
0.0142491196	cannot say
0.0142481974	has to do with
0.0142481974	i probably would have
0.0142472031	not your thing
0.0142470382	a few wines
0.0142460281	they were frozen
0.0142451012	service was very good and
0.0142432049	this place is the best
0.0142432049	i went with a
0.0142432049	also had a
0.0142432049	come back to
0.0142430406	was very tough
0.0142421486	new places and
0.0142420001	a good night
0.0142394779	on our food
0.0142379824	they have live
0.0142351121	will never come
0.0142322219	for over an hour

0.0142243611	our first meal
0.0142231737	chicken was a little
0.0142231737	friend and i got
0.0142231737	told it was a
0.0142231737	service i have ever
0.0142231737	pizza which was good
0.0142226618	and i thought i
0.0142219697	was a big
0.0142202599	wanted a good
0.0142194871	would have given them
0.0142184618	every bit as
0.0142183131	the pizza is always
0.0142145178	for a friday
0.0142144324	the meal was great
0.0142123416	$ 18 for
0.0142117956	it was odd
0.0142117956	a little busy
0.0142116221	to enjoy their food
0.0142099308	make the place
0.0142099308	is a beautiful
0.0142097760	i'm looking forward to going
0.0142093295	the quality of service
0.0142091749	that i live
0.0142085509	my husband took me
0.0142077368	they were extremely
0.0142064845	it was a monday
0.0142064845	i had to drive
0.0142064845	it was so busy
0.0142057022	a party of 5
0.0142048348	more than enough for the two
0.0142036457	get a bottle of wine
0.0142015382	we sat at the bar and
0.0142011001	when they bring
0.0142010660	not too small
0.0142001330	as it looked
0.0141981265	to cut through
0.0141980149	start by saying that i
0.0141976618	my friends and i decided to
0.0141946821	with the quality of the food
0.0141925443	we had no idea
0.0141924985	it was our fault
0.0141923119	expected to have
0.0141923119	server had no
0.0141910566	we were told the wait
0.0141900150	a small order of
0.0141897427	wouldn't know
0.0141874053	in the deli
0.0141874053	with a slightly
0.0141859132	you can get a
0.0141846739	i am giving them
0.0141825988	the pizza is really good
0.0141825988	at the bottom of the
0.0141825988	with a variety of
0.0141825988	i had been to
0.0141825988	i will not be
0.0141825988	when i went to
0.0141825988	is always good
0.0141825988	this is probably
0.0141825988	i also ordered a
0.0141825988	the end of
0.0141813943	in a separate
0.0141795573	we were able to order
0.0141767420	was also served
0.0141760660	was a mistake
0.0141760542	just had dinner
0.0141751367	than mine
0.0141749377	at the menu
0.0141746105	just a touch
0.0141746105	was really disappointed
0.0141746105	with a vanilla
0.0141744408	only $ 4
0.0141735727	when you call
0.0141732073	my boyfriend and i ordered
0.0141715740	they need more
0.0141690654	i probably wouldn't have
0.0141661994	such a long
0.0141644818	for dinner i ordered
0.0141644170	when we came in
0.0141644170	more of their
0.0141643541	was not happy
0.0141642774	we had 2
0.0141642025	order one of their
0.0141641977	but very rich
0.0141629157	you want good food
0.0141629001	expected to be
0.0141629001	waiter was really
0.0141625739	i will stick with
0.0141618985	just don't feel
0.0141602118	a table by the window
0.0141601177	which was extremely
0.0141601177	get your food
0.0141582711	with the salad
0.0141563353	but nowhere near
0.0141559036	a very romantic
0.0141540604	even gave me
0.0141508318	there were only 5
0.0141504310	you are getting
0.0141504310	to dine at
0.0141504310	as long as you
0.0141504310	especially if you are
0.0141504310	there's a lot of
0.0141504310	as we walked in
0.0141504310	a few different
0.0141504310	there were three
0.0141504310	to dine here
0.0141504310	the impression that
0.0141504310	it took forever to get
0.0141469610	this is good pizza
0.0141464470	was a little confused
0.0141450466	with the meat
0.0141439734	to return soon
0.0141433737	i am an italian
0.0141387779	if it's your first
0.0141361281	drive out of
0.0141341028	they have an amazing
0.0141338031	and still had to wait
0.0141338031	it was so tasty
0.0141331360	of those people who
0.0141316278	of us and we
0.0141315354	the same person
0.0141314598	to follow up
0.0141241429	a good steak
0.0141238354	ill be
0.0141216005	the meaning of
0.0141208161	it was very bland
0.0141208161	which was a great
0.0141200002	why so many
0.0141189808	of us decided
0.0141168863	a really great place
0.0141163584	i absolutely love their
0.0141137644	has a real
0.0141098887	go here all the time
0.0141098887	if you have not been
0.0141098887	is really good and the
0.0141091996	probably should
0.0141087189	like a fancy
0.0141086749	i have been there many times
0.0141086749	a good 10 minutes
0.0141080574	we finally tried
0.0141075979	not my favorite pizza
0.0141075681	a sign that said
0.0141074909	took our food
0.0141066645	that was going
0.0141030021	truly believe
0.0141022421	went above and beyond to make
0.0141020349	this place for the first time
0.0140968596	my dad and i
0.0140968596	would come back
0.0140968596	have a conversation with
0.0140955826	a good variety
0.0140955826	i was reading
0.0140946907	the chicken marsala was
0.0140941917	be seen
0.0140936173	we'll be back for
0.0140936173	cannot wait to go back and
0.0140918722	my first impression was
0.0140916897	i thought they were
0.0140862496	for some drinks
0.0140856508	the interior of the restaurant is
0.0140856508	have to deal with
0.0140856508	i thought it would
0.0140856508	very generous with the
0.0140854288	a little heavy
0.0140831947	of the valley
0.0140831947	a good atmosphere
0.0140831947	went to dinner
0.0140831947	have a special
0.0140812346	to try something new
0.0140812346	which were both
0.0140811841	regardless of what
0.0140805666	not sure i'll
0.0140787607	2 3 times a
0.0140770645	other than those
0.0140769061	way around
0.0140753615	which is a big
0.0140735079	i did not want to
0.0140735079	i decided to give
0.0140735079	the service was really good
0.0140735079	said it would be
0.0140735079	$ 10 for a
0.0140715434	and the service was outstanding
0.0140711472	night with a group of
0.0140705390	was accompanied by
0.0140680525	to give 5 stars
0.0140655739	get anywhere else
0.0140646380	me coming back
0.0140643445	was a disappointing
0.0140639117	a good number of
0.0140639117	i was only able to
0.0140639117	if you would like
0.0140622673	saw the menu
0.0140620039	ever had in a restaurant
0.0140616032	we had to try it
0.0140616032	i was excited to
0.0140610998	with a kick
0.0140610998	have a seat
0.0140610998	would have thought
0.0140610998	was not seasoned
0.0140604509	back in ny
0.0140571797	it was a lot of food
0.0140540264	of the bar area
0.0140533634	but i bet
0.0140519635	the most enjoyable
0.0140495370	not what you expect
0.0140461423	at least for me
0.0140449909	it's a local
0.0140443804	after we finished our
0.0140435607	and the toppings are
0.0140403194	in the joint
0.0140399951	it is a fun
0.0140395068	we got free
0.0140382990	just a simple
0.0140382065	a fun way
0.0140380464	in a wood
0.0140378903	all i could taste
0.0140345333	was a success
0.0140333655	the bathroom is
0.0140323605	are far better
0.0140322419	the whole experience was
0.0140317518	up to the club
0.0140307142	what i wanted to order
0.0140303819	plus for me
0.0140299409	for a quiet
0.0140266483	was an odd
0.0140261083	the texture of
0.0140229196	most definitely be
0.0140217176	decided to get a
0.0140214327	good but not
0.0140203371	which is why i
0.0140201485	sat at the bar and the
0.0140199365	my wife and i have been
0.0140199365	i didn't think it was
0.0140199365	i wasn't going to
0.0140199365	have a problem with
0.0140199365	this is by far the best
0.0140199365	this is the first
0.0140175516	you're looking for something
0.0140173888	seemed more like
0.0140121223	i was unable to
0.0140121223	a slice or two
0.0140095064	it was pretty decent
0.0140070697	food itself was
0.0140039865	a bad meal at
0.0140034075	could have been a bit
0.0140034075	got the same thing
0.0140034075	this is a definite
0.0140034075	we had to send
0.0140034075	found in the valley
0.0140028918	to contact me
0.0139987752	are too small
0.0139983910	was very nice and helpful
0.0139981974	i would never go back
0.0139981974	was actually very good
0.0139981974	one of the best i've had
0.0139960470	the best wings
0.0139923394	and the meatballs were
0.0139923394	and i loved the
0.0139923040	of the table and
0.0139923040	to go here and
0.0139912328	a very nice meal
0.0139905104	our meals came
0.0139878526	i feel bad for
0.0139861625	had to run
0.0139849372	because we were in
0.0139837775	for a date night or
0.0139827209	in the back and
0.0139815603	is strictly for
0.0139805142	it's easy to get
0.0139804177	to pick up a
0.0139791490	because of the price
0.0139786705	is as good as it gets
0.0139772763	need to eat
0.0139772763	in the south
0.0139772008	with a big group of
0.0139767732	for a weekday
0.0139750450	me a sample
0.0139742913	it was freaking
0.0139718143	was our fault
0.0139710422	seriously the best pizza
0.0139700687	good service and great
0.0139697310	nothing special at all
0.0139672031	was way too sweet
0.0139672031	they had no problem
0.0139662706	in front of the restaurant
0.0139661453	definitely will be back
0.0139661453	were able to get
0.0139661453	when i asked her
0.0139661453	we told her we
0.0139661453	you need to try
0.0139657440	the same family
0.0139630843	more likely to
0.0139627825	from someone who
0.0139615499	he told us about
0.0139609672	because of the reviews
0.0139602568	2 =
0.0139600477	was huge and
0.0139582272	but thats what
0.0139550828	i really enjoy this place
0.0139550828	i had a caesar salad
0.0139542405	the second time we went
0.0139542405	not the case here
0.0139526797	i've had better italian
0.0139511562	of the event
0.0139507555	and had no idea
0.0139505830	they appear to
0.0139498913	new to me
0.0139480072	appreciate the fact that
0.0139463624	and my wife had the
0.0139463624	and not too
0.0139462147	waitress did not
0.0139459969	didn't really want
0.0139457548	get a meal
0.0139446798	twice for lunch
0.0139445151	of the finest
0.0139434651	i wouldn't eat
0.0139380493	a sample of their
0.0139373274	of those times
0.0139367331	of the wood
0.0139363322	it was presented
0.0139362793	even offered to
0.0139338797	was a tiny
0.0139338797	had a seafood
0.0139338797	is a tiny
0.0139336228	i'm definitely not
0.0139331418	a bit pricey for
0.0139307661	has a special
0.0139293923	i can't say anything
0.0139264845	i had to write
0.0139264845	it was so big
0.0139264845	there is a line
0.0139264845	we had to stop
0.0139248959	very reasonably
0.0139237914	which is often
0.0139227174	it came out to
0.0139227174	why this place is
0.0139191444	big enough for a
0.0139161052	was one of the best things
0.0139161052	over to the bar
0.0139151124	and i have to say that
0.0139149903	didn't taste any
0.0139145954	the people walking
0.0139125739	my girlfriend and i went
0.0139125739	it's been a while since
0.0139097244	i was pleasantly surprised when
0.0139082246	to go for a
0.0139061349	was told that
0.0139043923	one can find
0.0139029967	for a nice restaurant
0.0139022355	it will be worth
0.0139021191	was very knowledgeable about the menu
0.0139021191	get away from the strip
0.0139005909	i was too
0.0139005830	much different than
0.0138999136	bite of it
0.0138984457	we both had the
0.0138974894	and the food was excellent
0.0138953255	he was very nice
0.0138953255	i had the grilled
0.0138951869	$ 3 more

0.0136825096	i wouldn't order it again
0.0136804446	a little pricey for what you
0.0136800756	that is to die for
0.0136771561	nearly as good as
0.0136771561	have been there twice
0.0136769867	as we sat
0.0136734577	into the neighborhood
0.0136729826	friends who had

0.0136644011	to find a great
0.0136633357	salad that comes
0.0136607994	they called me
0.0136593097	and 2 drinks
0.0136575189	than a chain

0.0136406569	be a 5
0.0136386974	here with some friends

0.0136354299	when i dine
0.0136350993	with the pork

0.0130099372	there was more than
0.0130099372	say it's a
0.0130055819	with no real
0.0130034075	when it comes to eating
0.0130034075	was a little greasy
0.0130034075	if you are coming
0.0130033768	a bit expensive for
0.0130022849	was a very nice
0.0130013453	to ask for water
0.0130009121	would be a great place
0.0130000780	on an off
0.0129942587	you might want
0.0129940646	takes time to
0.0129935112	and the portions are huge
0.0129930282	the last thing
0.0129923394	to come back and
0.0129923040	for pick up and

0.0129836554	but the service was horrible
0.0129826953	this place reminds me of
0.0129805142	i expect more
0.0129791585	else at the table
0.0129791490	there was a long
0.0129774403	of the sun
0.0129773585	was an off night

0.0129715189	and not very good
0.0129702369	for our dinner
0.0129696210	given the fact that
0.0129686454	it was okay but
0.0129672031	as a sign
0.0129661453	i would come back again

0.0116743888	the water show
0.0116742092	was only slightly
0.0116736552	of our questions
0.0116732476	the intention of
0.0116719827	my cousin had
0.0116707518	feel like going

0.0116678936	ravioli which was
0.0116637630	looking for a pizza

0.0116542870	go to the bar
0.0116536117	in the phx

0.0116527047	my friend had the chicken
0.0116518181	the same week
0.0116494162	and it took forever
0.0116482476	to let him know
0.0116482476	i assumed that
0.0116464929	the food and service is
0.0116446148	when you come in
0.0116446148	only complaint i have is that
0.0116446148	i was going to give
0.0116444060	the volume of
0.0116442032	the best italian food i've
0.0116422085	to the end
0.0116411443	the wait staff was friendly and

0.0116316278	it was possible to
0.0116316278	overall the experience was
0.0116291763	need to know
0.0116285290	i would hate
0.0116285290	going to stop

0.0116264682	the worst service i
0.0116251677	and were quickly

0.0116059926	as i looked
0.0116051508	decided to give them
0.0116033823	a side of garlic

0.0115832469	place was a
0.0115832469	steak was a
0.0115793891	the moment i walked in

0.0109473552	after sitting for

0.0109434772	a little difficult to
0.0109416788	if you like italian
0.0109406209	years and always
0.0109384618	the clientele is
0.0109384618	a little longer than
0.0109384618	the risk of

0.0104860279	first time having

0.0104560166	of the business
0.0104529296	for the rest of
0.0104529296	when i come
0.0104526372	is definitely worth the wait
0.0104525596	but it felt
0.0104514561	and the service was terrible

0.0100034075	you need to eat
0.0100034075	which is the only reason

0.0099729445	just gave up
0.0099729445	a drizzle of

0.0097461083	for a very long time
0.0097442710	along with a couple

0.0097222855	the custard is

0.0097183131	the sauce was a little
0.0097183131	in need of a
0.0097183131	is just as good
0.0097183131	was delicious as well
0.0097183131	if you go there
0.0097183131	for a restaurant that
0.0097183131	i also enjoyed the
0.0097183131	we each ordered a
0.0097183131	to work with
0.0097183131	that was the only
0.0097147932	i realize it's
0.0097130282	for our next visit
0.0097113441	not too sweet and not
0.0097113441	had the texture of
0.0097113441	will have to try
0.0097085509	never had anything like it
0.0097085509	in the basement of
0.0097085509	only reason i didn't give it
0.0097085509	i settled for the
0.0097069060	the cherry on top
0.0097069060	the joy of
0.0097063353	just wanted to get out of
0.0097063353	i have always wanted to
0.0097063353	when we got to the
0.0097063353	i noticed was the
0.0097063353	a beer and a
0.0097011562	i was working
0.0097011162	very apologetic and
0.0097001313	i have gone to
0.0097001313	so we decided to try it
0.0097001313	move on to the
0.0097001313	this was the only
0.0097001313	i had to send it back
0.0097001313	but that's about it
0.0097001313	i would go again
0.0097001313	but the quality is
0.0096991720	with the mussels
0.0096990641	which wasn't too
0.0096990499	ok but nothing
0.0096987003	and that's exactly
0.0096981862	if we would like
0.0096970651	of a group
0.0096966520	to give it a second chance
0.0096966185	my mind about
0.0096962962	the restaurant was clean and
0.0096927135	had the ravioli
0.0096927135	of the city
0.0096923489	just ate there
0.0096899978	and the service is awesome
0.0096899607	was amazed at how
0.0096897770	was my 2nd
0.0096881365	at a decent
0.0096876920	of the pies
0.0096861453	there were lots of
0.0096861453	it's nice to see
0.0096861453	may be a little
0.0096857364	is the best italian food
0.0096856321	they went above and beyond
0.0096850507	but it's worth
0.0096838172	was a 10
0.0096829157	he was kind
0.0096829157	while i enjoyed
0.0096829157	after we asked
0.0096825096	just like any other
0.0096778212	my sister ordered the
0.0096769236	have to sit in the
0.0096745087	the chocolate cake was
0.0096743888	very homey and
0.0096741384	probably the best part of
0.0096732945	go well with the
0.0096720782	i will give this place
0.0096696210	i can't speak for
0.0096696210	$ 22 for a
0.0096695846	looked a little
0.0096684410	from the rest
0.0096684142	have to give this place
0.0096613556	sent them
0.0096594895	to the website
0.0096585666	we were looking
0.0096578203	service i've ever had
0.0096577727	had the salmon which was
0.0096577727	it will be worth it
0.0096577727	i was very excited to try
0.0096577727	they are happy to
0.0096577727	the suggestion of the
0.0096571009	he loves it
0.0096551992	used to go to
0.0096536117	always a fun
0.0096536117	was not overcooked
0.0096536117	really just wanted
0.0096530310	have to love
0.0096472300	a reservation for
0.0096448236	i can not wait
0.0096446210	the memory of
0.0096446148	not what it used to be
0.0096435034	friends or a
0.0096435034	busy but we
0.0096435034	lunch here with
0.0096411934	but it's pretty
0.0096405501	are always nice
0.0096400339	he asked if
0.0096393728	of the whole meal
0.0096361052	the best dish of the night
0.0096361052	like to sit at the bar
0.0096361052	of the other dishes
0.0096360336	this is definitely one of
0.0096350212	i had the caprese
0.0096350212	we had a server
0.0096337119	our server came over
0.0096328217	we were greeted warmly and
0.0096316876	they had run out
0.0096316278	this is why i
0.0096314288	something else on the menu
0.0096299853	give it 3
0.0096291763	i wonder if they
0.0096291763	i hate it when
0.0096291763	everyone was happy with
0.0096289606	of the 8
0.0096272692	in the grand
0.0096252234	and were excited
0.0096251677	as i was hoping
0.0096237684	the food is delicious and the
0.0096237684	the prices are a little
0.0096197289	part about this place
0.0096181893	part of this place
0.0096168999	you can tell that
0.0096168999	so that's what
0.0096149455	so bad that
0.0096139279	they were very friendly
0.0096099455	any place that
0.0096098887	go out of their way to
0.0096092222	i felt like i had
0.0096092222	the best way to
0.0096089786	nice to find
0.0096089786	eat the whole
0.0096089786	order a whole
0.0096059926	was very fast
0.0096059926	if you asked
0.0096047319	i liked how
0.0096035215	best italian food i have had
0.0096030314	full by the time
0.0096030314	had a bit too much
0.0096030314	some of these
0.0096015471	to try more items
0.0095998428	that was worth
0.0095998428	with the bottle
0.0095997072	it's really hard to
0.0095996659	i think this is the
0.0095994422	we had the pasta
0.0095979605	they are trying
0.0095973175	last night for the first time
0.0095973175	they have a variety of

0.0095939011	a great place to come
0.0095880609	it is totally
0.0095880609	to the actual

0.0095832887	to eat at this place
0.0095832469	nice but not

0.0095765809	get your pizza
0.0095753368	bread is the best
0.0095746955	looks like they
0.0095745705	appreciate that they
0.0095676779	only negative is that
0.0095665803	thing is they
0.0095665803	left with the
0.0095636707	of the crowd
0.0095618245	we decided to eat here
0.0095613611	that they use

0.0095421505	i want to order
0.0095419186	to have them

0.0095310516	there are better italian
0.0095309837	and my wife ordered the
0.0095262218	the food was fresh and
0.0095261083	i can make a
0.0095261083	was by far the
0.0095261083	me a new one
0.0095260432	we'll be back again
0.0095251093	you would find in
0.0095238544	and other italian
0.0095238544	so i was a bit
0.0095196326	i took one bite
0.0095184156	was still a bit
0.0095155866	for a bottle of
0.0095121223	to take a picture of
0.0095121223	we will certainly be back
0.0095121223	but not great either
0.0095121223	was actually quite good
0.0095121223	all you need to know
0.0095121223	we were taken care of
0.0095121223	we probably would have
0.0095121223	is always a plus
0.0095111399	were looking for a
0.0095105968	and the meat sauce was
0.0095105790	bread was very good
0.0095088880	pizza is good but
0.0095088880	wait was a little
0.0095088880	service is a little
0.0095072532	came out of
0.0095053264	and i got a
0.0095048084	was drowning in
0.0095046793	good and the service was excellent
0.0095032584	have been better off
0.0095032584	the only customers in
0.0095004839	all of the italian
0.0095002338	is because the service
0.0095002175	i am not sure how
0.0094985348	would give them
0.0094967238	in the game
0.0094955149	at the top of my
0.0094923394	and it was the best
0.0094923394	like they were
0.0094906861	it a 4 star
0.0094906861	had the thin crust
0.0094906861	it did not taste
0.0094884881	be going back there
0.0094883311	more than the food
0.0094876386	they make you feel
0.0094867476	it is cooked
0.0094867476	with the yummy
0.0094867476	in the cold
0.0094867476	with the warm
0.0094867476	of the meatballs
0.0094867476	of the worst
0.0094849014	i eat a lot of
0.0094849014	the restaurant is located in
0.0094845374	were planning to
0.0094829613	the best calamari
0.0094817522	had a problem
0.0094810222	i came here with a
0.0094806958	off with the calamari
0.0094783290	just melted in
0.0094781813	it was full of flavor
0.0094763988	by a very nice
0.0094752676	of my house
0.0094730348	because the food is
0.0094700911	a strip mall next to
0.0094633894	good but nothing special
0.0094633724	would go back just for
0.0094621125	it was one of the worst
0.0094614650	we were seated in the bar
0.0094613441	i don't want to be
0.0094613441	the only thing i could
0.0094613441	in order to make
0.0094602780	with the ingredients
0.0094596739	only complaint would be
0.0094560166	they were pretty
0.0094560166	is a fun
0.0094522219	came with 4
0.0094494394	want to have a
0.0094475381	to the host
0.0094470651	to the fact
0.0094470651	to a local
0.0094469870	else on the menu
0.0094469870	is that the service
0.0094469870	back to this restaurant
0.0094469870	was a little light
0.0094469870	to get a quick
0.0094469313	even though the place
0.0094462996	the meatball pizza and
0.0094452318	and the wine selection was
0.0094444227	i tried it and
0.0094441360	i think he's
0.0094440654	had been wanting to try
0.0094440176	for our wait
0.0094437500	last time i ate
0.0094420697	was very kind
0.0094385091	bad to say
0.0094382555	back and try the pizza
0.0094382555	was just a bad
0.0094382555	have had in years
0.0094351992	they did have a
0.0094351992	also ordered a side of
0.0094351992	want to be there
0.0094351992	probably not the best
0.0094351992	i'd have to
0.0094321325	the pizza sauce was
0.0094316547	the food and drinks were
0.0094314911	that range from
0.0094313620	is the best in vegas
0.0094313620	is always a great
0.0094313620	has a very nice
0.0094280930	with the quality of food
0.0094263353	go back and give
0.0094257011	don't care for
0.0094254308	one member of
0.0094242476	of the main
0.0094240599	it would be fun
0.0094232945	to get in and out
0.0094218424	wrong with this
0.0094218424	dinner before we
0.0094216644	to be the manager
0.0094198008	with the honey
0.0094192575	and have always enjoyed
0.0094175753	up to the restaurant
0.0094168653	the fried calamari was
0.0094161284	as soon as we sat
0.0094144179	packed when we
0.0094115911	atmosphere is really
0.0094115911	thing i could
0.0094092672	like you are sitting
0.0094079282	and a cool
0.0094071009	to hear each other

0.0093974522	ordered two of
0.0093969726	i think i'll
0.0093967699	i will admit that
0.0093962403	is big enough for
0.0093924035	with a crunchy
0.0093915740	needs to get
0.0093907943	and the service is excellent
0.0093893728	and would eat
0.0093880221	pizza is okay
0.0093863253	i had the duck
0.0093843143	a try if you are

0.0093816278	could be a little more
0.0093768596	so far so good
0.0093766057	by far the best italian
0.0093751693	and the food was mediocre
0.0093718502	is very cool
0.0093718502	of our party
0.0093718502	and then left
0.0093668269	have never had a bad
0.0093660171	took nearly
0.0093654117	the mood for some
0.0093628914	was the music
0.0093603629	the bartender was friendly and
0.0093572950	seem to get
0.0093564652	were fresh and
0.0093547955	the margherita pizza was
0.0093542002	it didn't taste like
0.0093541900	only thing i could
0.0093538988	cream on the side
0.0093535079	i don't even like
0.0093502359	and my other friend
0.0093502359	we had to eat
0.0093491763	back here again
0.0093491763	i figured it would be
0.0093491763	my main course was
0.0093491763	i did find
0.0093489936	2 stars instead of
0.0093474599	with a tomato
0.0093472664	and it makes
0.0093412132	we will be back again
0.0093412132	my mom got the
0.0093412132	we found out that
0.0093412132	i finally made it
0.0093412132	said that he
0.0093412132	could make it
0.0093410215	only been open for
0.0093380433	will eat here again
0.0093360184	i made reservations for
0.0093360184	we were served by

0.0093356721	that side of town
0.0093351567	i will never go to
0.0093346109	and a medium
0.0093258063	there was hardly
0.0093247782	i think it may
0.0093230314	to catch up with
0.0093230314	my brother had the
0.0093230314	a bed of
0.0093230314	is supposed to
0.0093218598	for about 5
0.0093215836	a tomato sauce that
0.0093215732	area has a
0.0093215732	family here for
0.0093171339	you can't beat that
0.0093143413	was a delightful
0.0093112441	they were super
0.0093112441	for a fancy
0.0093107364	i thought it was great
0.0093103773	this is definitely the place

0.0093061651	time for the check
0.0093061651	also had a salad
0.0093016795	have experienced in
0.0093010062	on a mission to

0.0092995849	one of the better ones
0.0092987729	this place has some
0.0092985390	don't think i will be

0.0092907260	have been to many
0.0092904350	the crust was a little
0.0092904350	the atmosphere and the
0.0092889141	only regret is that

0.0092771305	but let me tell you
0.0092749797	which is normally
0.0092722532	the food and the service were
0.0092722532	that they give
0.0092712167	for a place to eat
0.0092705368	in a spicy

0.0092642901	so that was a
0.0092642901	my friend got a
0.0092642901	a good way
0.0092642901	the pizza is so good

0.0090649978	and the spaghetti and
0.0090649978	and the food was very
0.0090649978	the wait was a
0.0090649978	this dish was a
0.0090649978	for a bit of
0.0090649978	as it is a
0.0090649739	as soon as we were

0.0090616032	but not enough to
0.0090604495	the loss of
0.0090594081	well over $
0.0090561014	to send back
0.0090560721	i've ever had in vegas
0.0090560721	it was an interesting
0.0090560721	a full menu

0.0090437212	for lunch on a
0.0090437212	a bit more of

0.0090035788	the bolognese sauce was
0.0090034075	i haven't had a bad
0.0090034075	because i had heard

0.0082642901	it was a little too
0.0082642901	but the food was just
0.0082642901	if you have time
0.0082642901	but it is still
0.0082642901	at the top
0.0082642901	some of the best i have
0.0082642901	i was not impressed with the
0.0082617875	a side of sauce

0.0082461083	probably some of the best
0.0082461083	was very kind and
0.0082461083	not only is it
0.0082461083	to get them to
0.0082461083	what you like
0.0082455465	which is a bit
0.0082428075	this little hole in
0.0082427841	they were happy to
0.0082359554	i was planning on
0.0082359554	i would have sent
0.0082351060	are so many better
0.0082337486	it was actually pretty
0.0082334250	pizza is one of the
0.0082317084	it was actually really
0.0082305291	the pizza's were
0.0082288975	not nearly as good
0.0082245331	might be a bit
0.0082238005	go here for lunch
0.0082233462	actually made me
0.0082226618	i have always wanted to try
0.0082226618	i would expect from a
0.0082226618	to try a new
0.0082226618	is that this place is
0.0082223552	my only wish
0.0082185965	i couldn't get enough
0.0082180615	what i mean
0.0082128445	i had the spinach
0.0082115110	you really need
0.0082108181	and there was already
0.0082093078	we had a good experience
0.0082093078	this was the best pizza
0.0082088895	but well worth
0.0082085582	i wouldn't come back
0.0082085582	you're going to be
0.0082085582	since we were going
0.0082030762	many other options in
0.0082001330	was really cool
0.0081996425	each time i've
0.0081976618	if you have never had
0.0081976618	i can not wait to
0.0081972257	would be nice if they
0.0081968887	we tried a few
0.0081940654	to call back
0.0081940654	she tried to
0.0081940654	i can't tell you how
0.0081940654	they treat you like
0.0081940654	on the edge of
0.0081903589	for a better experience
0.0081868245	how long the wait was
0.0081844810	am in love with
0.0081817762	tried a bite of
0.0081775527	might be able to
0.0081763353	i asked to speak to the
0.0081690654	i could not believe how
0.0081690654	has been open for
0.0081690654	want to keep it
0.0081690654	had to ask her
0.0081690654	i haven't had any
0.0081690654	don't even have
0.0081682985	liked it better
0.0081681862	i was not a fan of
0.0081663112	and let me just
0.0081663112	i think next time
0.0081630315	even though the restaurant
0.0081588223	better options in
0.0081578665	he was very friendly
0.0081520754	can tell they
0.0081496840	there the other night
0.0081496840	we got our pizza
0.0081496840	which had a nice
0.0081475907	need to work
0.0081469236	i had to tell
0.0081464470	if you're looking for a place
0.0081427094	at least twice a
0.0081369898	and there was no wait
0.0081369898	and the service is top notch
0.0081369898	that you can order
0.0081369898	and the overall experience
0.0081361281	place is getting
0.0081361281	things on their
0.0081361281	deal for me
0.0081340590	i tried to eat
0.0081316351	as a place to
0.0081292324	was delicate and
0.0081280520	the white pizza is
0.0081275842	to come back to try
0.0081246486	more places like
0.0081222868	and had a decent
0.0081218119	this place after seeing
0.0081216005	my friend and her
0.0081216005	you expect from a
0.0081199656	to start and it was
0.0081199656	the edge of the
0.0081199656	it was creamy and
0.0081190497	to our neighborhood
0.0081180137	is reasonably priced and
0.0081171423	i did have to
0.0081171423	but it was good enough
0.0081171423	we came on a
0.0081171423	is that this is
0.0081171423	i didn't have time
0.0081171423	was wonderful and the
0.0081156736	a great place to have a
0.0081156736	the time it takes to
0.0081147396	would recommend this
0.0081119642	go here a lot
0.0081117379	price is very
0.0081111202	we waited over
0.0081099241	has been one of my
0.0081096958	i will be trying
0.0081096958	back for another
0.0081095871	the freshness of
0.0081094024	always make it a
0.0081094024	got to try this
0.0081024254	or on a date
0.0081024254	to make you feel
0.0081024254	with a little extra
0.0081024254	for the whole family
0.0081024254	there for my birthday
0.0081024254	we had an appetizer
0.0081020349	and i tried it
0.0081017334	but i have a feeling
0.0081017334	but by the time we left
0.0081006859	was simple yet
0.0080988825	we devoured it
0.0080988197	of my party
0.0080959216	is right down the street from
0.0080954038	so far i've
0.0080949656	the service is good and the
0.0080940830	am a big fan of
0.0080921423	was perfect and the
0.0080921423	was probably one of the
0.0080921423	there were a few people
0.0080921423	you have to ask
0.0080899978	but i didn't want
0.0080899978	to the bar to
0.0080899978	have a full bar and
0.0080899978	have to go back and
0.0080899978	we were going to a
0.0080899978	were very happy with the
0.0080899978	it is not on
0.0080899978	we didn't get to
0.0080899978	was great and we
0.0080899978	of the bread and
0.0080899978	to many of the
0.0080899978	the bar at the
0.0080899978	was only one
0.0080882416	not sure if it's
0.0080861084	which is a great
0.0080861084	which is a nice
0.0080815603	been sitting here

0.0080755221	choose one of
0.0080755221	times can be
0.0080755221	food is above
0.0080736202	we grabbed a
0.0080735079	but it was still good
0.0080735079	it also came with
0.0080687212	they have some of
0.0080687212	my experience at this
0.0080687212	that they were out
0.0080687212	though it was not
0.0080687212	had not been to
0.0080680291	a group of us went
0.0080667396	it has taken
0.0080664506	i would not order
0.0080661374	this place for years and
0.0080656974	to walk around and
0.0080649978	that was one of the
0.0080649978	and the taste of
0.0080649978	and the staff are
0.0080649978	the restaurant and i
0.0080649978	and they offer a
0.0080649978	came out and i
0.0080649978	to see that the
0.0080649978	in the day and
0.0080649978	go again and
0.0080649978	and it was nice to
0.0080649978	try their pizza and
0.0080649978	we ordered from the
0.0080649978	and they told us
0.0080641871	not sure if i'd
0.0080617960	really impressed with
0.0080616032	i would not go back
0.0080616032	not much of a
0.0080610998	by a local
0.0080600667	they were a bit
0.0080560721	just a few tables
0.0080556201	i had a good experience
0.0080540316	i had known
0.0080529650	but that's another
0.0080512046	my only complaint would be the
0.0080484271	and ask him
0.0080473219	isn't much to
0.0080448245	in shorts and
0.0080446775	and the sauces are
0.0080437212	was a piece of
0.0080437212	good and the food was
0.0080437212	was not to be
0.0080437212	is not in the
0.0080427146	i am always looking
0.0080421423	i probably would not
0.0080421266	a table for 2
0.0080411274	any of the food
0.0080411274	due to the service
0.0080399951	is a very small
0.0080379708	and i decided to try
0.0080379708	and i stopped in
0.0080379708	of all of the
0.0080379708	and was served with
0.0080377146	i was told it was
0.0080348148	food is quite
0.0080340300	on us often
0.0080338899	us throughout the
0.0080329486	to be completely
0.0080329486	was not greasy
0.0080328918	had forgotten to
0.0080327727	there was just enough
0.0080326822	you ask me
0.0080326720	to save some
0.0080299409	of our dishes
0.0080290316	and even gave us
0.0080290316	i was doing
0.0080271500	have ever tried
0.0080262332	and my friend had a
0.0080255024	it was very flavorful
0.0080255024	here with my family
0.0080255024	all about the food
0.0080206316	the edge of
0.0080204342	an establishment that
0.0080204342	you tell them
0.0080180723	a review for the
0.0080178297	tasted as good as
0.0080166942	on the menu but i
0.0080148930	very attentive to our needs
0.0080135806	we got our food and
0.0080135806	and i didn't have
0.0080135806	that it was so
0.0080135806	and the flavor of
0.0080135806	and a lot more
0.0080135806	the best in the
0.0080135806	and they have some
0.0080116720	which was absolutely
0.0080115809	asking if we
0.0080106954	a large pizza with
0.0080081788	a few times now
0.0080073214	for 6 people
0.0080071009	especially given the
0.0080059254	i'll give it
0.0080034075	would be a regular
0.0080034075	really liked this place
0.0080023700	but i think that's
0.0080014211	would have been better with
0.0079994223	our appetizers were
0.0079993699	the presence of
0.0079991088	like a cheap
0.0079990230	another glass of
0.0079977596	probably one of
0.0079960470	on the north
0.0079917827	i've been looking
0.0079911264	is run by
0.0079911060	it would be nice to have
0.0079911060	the only way to go
0.0079911060	my wife and i stopped in
0.0079894724	he never came
0.0079894663	the booths were
0.0079886606	but if you're in the
0.0079876203	have found it
0.0079867158	took me back
0.0079865654	we headed to
0.0079847023	so we settled on
0.0079839163	about 5 minutes after
0.0079834838	on a romantic
0.0079812227	made sure we had
0.0079803518	they treat you
0.0079791490	it had the perfect
0.0079772763	had more flavor
0.0079771085	all i could taste was the
0.0079771085	they are trying to
0.0079771085	to say about this
0.0079749797	gives me a
0.0079742915	want to say
0.0079729445	a staple in
0.0079727200	i've gone here
0.0079717577	a cool little
0.0079710422	part of a large
0.0079696210	is a serious
0.0079693669	my least favorite of the
0.0079673925	probably come back
0.0079667300	the bottom line is that
0.0079667300	in the last year
0.0079667300	the chef came out
0.0079661453	it seemed as if
0.0079655952	was able to try
0.0079643840	it was good and i
0.0079636606	it is one of our
0.0079625319	was good and the service
0.0079625096	right in front of us
0.0079625096	came over to us
0.0079625096	i have worked in

0.0077846473	just wasn't great
0.0077846473	of the story

0.0077011562	of the box

0.0074909550	only reason why i
0.0074897014	and it was quite
0.0074890061	15 minutes before we
0.0074876386	was probably the worst
0.0074867476	was a problem

0.0074867476	and then ordered
0.0074867476	of the sweet
0.0074867476	was not fresh
0.0074861926	with the rest of the
0.0074861926	was also a
0.0074860894	different from the
0.0074859554	have had much better
0.0074852083	by far the best pizza in
0.0074846866	i took a few
0.0074846088	which i thought was a nice
0.0074844531	did not skimp on the
0.0074810222	for a date or
0.0074810222	have to go back
0.0074783290	even finish it

0.0074733627	been here twice now and
0.0074730348	and he was very
0.0074695233	the bar next door and

0.0074585582	for him to come

0.0074563353	it was the perfect amount
0.0074563353	you don't want to be
0.0074544126	wouldn't want to
0.0074541285	to find good pizza

0.0074507256	on the menu that i
0.0074494394	can be a bit of a
0.0074489909	always made sure
0.0074481862	one side of the
0.0074476233	can get a bit
0.0074470963	they did a great
0.0074469870	this is the best restaurant
0.0074469870	this is the only thing
0.0074469870	i had the margarita
0.0074469870	to find a restaurant
0.0074469870	about everything on the menu
0.0074469870	is that the restaurant
0.0074469870	i got the baked
0.0074469870	it had a lot
0.0074469870	has the best italian
0.0074469870	you want to order

0.0074248576	to pay $
0.0074242476	with the chocolate
0.0074242476	and i added

0.0074175753	good but the sauce
0.0074175753	there are a couple

0.0073996425	you haven't been

0.0073948673	for the thin crust
0.0073948358	with the garlic
0.0073919642	comes with a small
0.0073919642	seems like a great
0.0073912249	like most people

0.0073332933	there are others
0.0073323441	you have a choice
0.0073281563	every bit as good
0.0073268221	a table outside

0.0073249178	all i can say
0.0073249178	right in the middle of the
0.0073249178	when i go to
0.0073232941	of mine who
0.0073230314	i plan to go back
0.0073230314	more than i did
0.0073230314	every time i go there

0.0073216242	were just okay
0.0073205291	flavor in my
0.0073179442	was a good deal

0.0073162516	always get the same
0.0073162516	have a friend who
0.0073145099	very knowledgable and
0.0073127581	without making a
0.0073095871	we were treated like
0.0073079334	is a little high
0.0073061651	good but not worth
0.0073051991	and the staff is very friendly
0.0072995849	on the streets of
0.0072981197	going to try the
0.0072959908	didn't even say
0.0072951284	food was so good

0.0072904350	i went in with

0.0072904350	was a bit on the
0.0072904350	i have never been to
0.0072904350	it was probably the best
0.0072898995	to ask how everything
0.0072877412	wish they would have
0.0072877412	is exactly what you
0.0072877412	i would probably give
0.0072834075	when we were finally
0.0072826995	are greeted by a
0.0072799964	the better ones
0.0072782753	i forgot how

0.0072722532	the best thing we had
0.0072722532	i made the mistake of

0.0071514826	and not a single
0.0071501563	from the back of

0.0071487801	come here every time
0.0071477860	that complimented the
0.0071476100	could be a bit
0.0071469236	he was having a
0.0071469236	i am sure i will
0.0071450346	anything else on the

0.0071436738	at the edge of the

0.0071349731	for starters we had
0.0071344584	we came here on a
0.0071344584	at the back of the
0.0071344427	a great variety of
0.0071344259	not included in
0.0071337926	know if they have
0.0071337926	be back to try some

0.0071171423	we walked up to the
0.0071171423	i have been looking for
0.0071171423	was so impressed that
0.0071171423	only thing is that

0.0071171423	to find a new
0.0071171423	the food or the
0.0071171423	the best restaurant in
0.0071171423	the feel of a
0.0071171423	there are a lot of other
0.0071171423	the best italian restaurant i have
0.0071171423	say it was the best
0.0071171423	from the food to the
0.0071171423	were very fresh and
0.0071171423	for a server to
0.0071171423	as though we were
0.0071171423	after a night of
0.0071171423	make it back to
0.0071171423	which was the only
0.0071171423	and the wings are
0.0071171423	and the basil was
0.0071156736	so happy that we
0.0071156736	that we would have to
0.0071156736	to order a second
0.0071137644	made a special
0.0071127429	him to come

0.0071094024	i had dinner here last
0.0071094024	of been better

0.0071051122	is coming from someone who
0.0071031563	without a doubt the best
0.0071027344	so many other
0.0070989374	but it turned out
0.0070972593	definitely eat here again
0.0070943857	way too long to
0.0070921423	so i decided to try it
0.0070921423	and a drink for $
0.0070921423	are the way to go
0.0070921423	were all very good
0.0070921423	my girl and i
0.0070906157	our server was attentive and
0.0070899978	and i came here for
0.0070899978	and i found this
0.0070899978	a sample of the
0.0070899978	and i ate there
0.0070899978	we were told that it
0.0070899978	was the best part of
0.0070899978	with the quality of the
0.0070899978	at the bar and the
0.0070899978	that is why it
0.0070899978	to the area and
0.0070899978	with the meal was
0.0070899978	and were looking for
0.0070899978	i make sure to
0.0070899978	ever had in the
0.0070899978	for dinner the other
0.0070899739	would give this
0.0070887359	good place to grab a
0.0070882416	not far from
0.0070852651	described on the
0.0070845099	mostly because it
0.0070809434	to get some food
0.0070799964	took over an
0.0070784279	the only reason why
0.0070781563	my bf had the
0.0070781563	i wouldn't come here
0.0070781563	usually not a fan of

0.0070755221	hour for our
0.0070755221	maggiano's is a
0.0070755221	heaven on a
0.0070744709	this is hands down
0.0070735079	not the best i've had
0.0070731330	and a friend of
0.0070729910	at a fraction of
0.0070710491	too pricey for
0.0070706255	on top of each
0.0070695256	they don't skimp on the
0.0070687212	was a bit too much
0.0070687212	is a little on the
0.0070687212	we always get a
0.0070687212	was that there was
0.0070687212	that you don't have

0.0070649978	the pasta on the

0.0070529694	a year now
0.0070512046	been there several times and

0.0070437212	the time we were there
0.0070437212	was cold and the
0.0070437212	the pizza did not
0.0070427146	wouldn't make a
0.0070421423	give it a go
0.0070421283	was even better than

0.0070399951	to try this restaurant
0.0070388312	very modern and
0.0070379708	and it was hard to

0.0070275250	i'd come here
0.0070271500	by several times to
0.0070271500	good news is that
0.0070265033	to work there

0.0070262332	i was on my way
0.0070262332	i decided i would
0.0070262046	because she was
0.0070255024	for a few drinks
0.0070237690	the best ive had
0.0070230252	to catch a
0.0070215894	i have no problem
0.0070170321	is nothing short of
0.0070168697	he took care of
0.0070166942	in the near
0.0070166942	it was because of

0.0070135806	the service was good but
0.0070135806	and it was such a
0.0070135806	and many of the
0.0070135806	and i think that
0.0070135806	and you will get
0.0070135806	and i can only
0.0070135806	which was on the
0.0070135806	and our drinks were

0.0070135806	and our waitress was very
0.0070116720	when i brought
0.0070106681	was drowned in
0.0070099372	it was because it

0.0070099372	to me in a
0.0070099372	this is definitely one
0.0070076439	really like the pizza
0.0070034075	we were not impressed
0.0070034075	was probably the best thing
0.0070034075	a party of 6
0.0070012332	it is a good place to
0.0070012332	i do not want to
0.0070012332	in and out of the
0.0070012332	we were in for a
0.0070012332	a while to get
0.0069993699	get our own
0.0069989038	about 20 minutes after
0.0069952942	made you feel like
0.0069952942	for the past few
0.0069925800	this was the highlight
0.0069924733	those of us
0.0069917813	it was closer to
0.0069917813	it was our first
0.0069916012	i said i would
0.0069916012	you can make it
0.0069911264	because he didn't

0.0069904382	is definitely worth it
0.0069876203	didn't really like
0.0069864443	and the sauce is
0.0069844531	going here again
0.0069839180	that would make
0.0069832756	the manager said

0.0069772763	were on point

0.0069771085	i feel it is
0.0069771085	this place seems to
0.0069771085	not bad but not
0.0069771085	the service has always been good
0.0069719895	of the store

0.0067011562	to the movie
0.0067006915	you can ask for
0.0067006915	may be the best
0.0067006915	the only reason i gave it

0.0060667765	will not be going
0.0060667765	and asked if everything

0.0060649978	and it was just the
0.0060649978	it was good but the
0.0060649978	it was because i
0.0060649978	we came in with
0.0060649978	was good for a
0.0060649978	of the time and

0.0060560721	with their house
0.0060540316	the friendliness of the

0.0059923040	good service and the
0.0059923040	for a pizza and

0.0059923040	and we split a
0.0059923040	i know that the
0.0059923040	and a good value
0.0059923040	and we went with
0.0059923040	and the menu has
0.0059923040	and the bartenders were
0.0059917813	and it was better than

0.0059894663	used to come
0.0059894663	nothing to do

0.0059771085	i will go to
0.0059771085	we got to see

0.0059667300	what appeared to be a
0.0059667300	every time we come to
0.0059667300	was more than enough for
0.0059667300	what i expected from
0.0059667300	with a friend who
0.0059667300	enough to take
0.0059667300	made me feel like i
0.0059660453	had a pizza and
0.0059659169	a friend of

0.0059082246	that we were going to
0.0059082246	i wanted to try the
0.0059082246	and you can taste the

0.0059063525	their pasta is
0.0059042997	which is hard to

0.0058898069	the owner is always
0.0058898069	and the shrimp was
0.0058892852	so i asked for a

0.0050265033	just wish they had
0.0050264611	and offered us a
0.0050262332	my boyfriend and i decided to
0.0050262046	but that doesn't
0.0050260692	a little disappointed with the
0.0050260692	would come back for the
0.0050260692	the valley of the
0.0050260692	have a selection of

0.0050230252	a groupon for
0.0050230252	to add some
0.0050217157	and well worth the

0.0050189985	had to deal with
0.0050168636	never come back to
0.0050168636	have to admit that
0.0050166942	it was a bit of
0.0050166942	other than that it was
0.0050166942	the crust of the
0.0050166942	was not on the
0.0050166942	have been in the
0.0050166942	the bar to get
0.0050166942	i had to see
0.0050166942	this location and i
0.0050166942	he was in the
0.0050166942	the bar which is
0.0050166942	was tender and the
0.0050166942	with the bread is
0.0050166942	to me when i
0.0050166942	we had to try
0.0050166942	this place is one of
0.0050166942	i think this place has
0.0050166942	this place because of the
0.0050166942	the food was out of
0.0050166942	the table with the
0.0050166942	once for lunch and
0.0050166942	i am on a
0.0050166942	as i am a
0.0050166942	as we had to
0.0050161276	be a lot better
0.0050161276	had the linguini with
0.0050161276	i read some of
0.0050135806	it was pretty good and
0.0050135806	and it was a little
0.0050135806	and i really liked the
0.0050135806	and if you have a
0.0050114296	going to take a
0.0050114296	want to take a
0.0050114296	a place where you

0.0050105796	was very polite and
0.0050095379	and she told me
0.0050095379	was looking forward to
0.0050079924	see any of
0.0050056552	you can see from
0.0050050913	everything is homemade and
0.0050050913	and a drizzle of
0.0050016790	and this is coming from
0.0050016790	we got up to
0.0050016790	was really fresh and
0.0050016790	came in on a
0.0050016790	us that they were
0.0050016790	to go up to
0.0050012332	one bite of the
0.0050010692	but they were really
0.0050009371	and the mushrooms were
0.0050009371	we had a great time and
0.0050009371	i was in the
0.0050009371	and the music is
0.0050008167	when i come to
0.0050008167	a good option for
0.0049996404	and they sat us
0.0049993699	you can tell he
0.0049987239	try this place because
0.0049970493	the atmosphere is a little
0.0049930723	so close to my
0.0049930723	to eat the whole
0.0049924733	i have heard about
0.0049923040	for dinner on a
0.0049923040	it was the fact that

0.0049923040	on all of the
0.0049923040	this is a little
0.0049923040	and then i had
0.0049923040	i think that the
0.0049923040	i am in a
0.0049923040	they are in a
0.0049923040	that i have to
0.0049923040	the meal we had
0.0049923040	was ok but the
0.0049923040	was just enough
0.0049923040	to pick it up and
0.0049917813	i was a little disappointed that
0.0049917813	he was attentive and

0.0049917813	we told the
0.0049916012	you would get in
0.0049905985	from the moment we
0.0049905985	he could not
0.0049905985	that she could
0.0049905985	we began with the
0.0049905985	and a splash of
0.0049905985	something about it
0.0049904382	it takes to get
0.0049904382	haven't been to this
0.0049894724	was limp and

0.0049844026	because i want to
0.0049844026	since it was an
0.0049844026	for lunch and had

0.0049636606	that is what you

0.0049630409	has a hint of
0.0049630409	to anyone who is
0.0049628922	and on top of that
0.0049628922	of course it was
0.0049625096	are pretty good too
0.0049625096	the sauce they use

0.0049550302	the service was above
0.0049550090	all in all it was
0.0049526455	say this was a
0.0049521085	want to get
0.0049505833	not up to par with
0.0049505833	where you can get a
0.0049505833	probably would have been
0.0049505833	probably would have
0.0049505833	way to make
0.0049505833	going to make
0.0049505833	just adds to the
0.0049501146	they are out of

0.0049501146	and it is really
0.0049501146	was very dry and
0.0049501146	but i enjoyed it
0.0049501146	that we were in
0.0049501146	i think there was
0.0049501146	that is what i
0.0049501146	about the restaurant and
0.0049501146	but the wait is
0.0049501146	but that was not
0.0049498913	because they were so
0.0049498913	always a good
0.0049498913	i was very pleased with the
0.0049498913	if you are in vegas and
0.0049498913	and they gave me a
0.0049498913	so much so that i
0.0049498913	the owner came out and
0.0049498913	i looked around and
0.0049498913	was the lack of
0.0049498913	i would go with
0.0049498913	but you know what
0.0049498913	i had not been
0.0049498913	most of the people

0.0049460086	in here on a
0.0049452616	going on in

0.0049417300	i have never seen a
0.0049417300	to pick up some
0.0049414922	but i'm not going
0.0049414922	what we were going
0.0049405163	and the service is always
0.0049405163	that the restaurant was
0.0049405163	for the kids and
0.0049405163	we were a little
0.0049405163	and the ambiance was
0.0049405163	it is a little
0.0049393840	it is one of the
0.0049342663	i guess this is
0.0049342663	you order at the counter and
0.0049322472	i can see how it
0.0049322472	last time i went there

0.0049322472	i hate to be
0.0049322472	only one or two

0.0049322472	know what they are
0.0049322472	so glad to have
0.0049316969	i know what i
0.0049316969	might be a good

0.0041940654	what better way to
0.0041889674	ever return to
0.0041889674	i live right
0.0041867558	i ordered one of the
0.0041867558	it was served with was
0.0041867558	it was far from
0.0041867558	it was tender and
0.0041867558	is delicious and the
0.0041834415	to do the same
0.0041814063	i just can't get
0.0041814063	went there on a
0.0041783366	went on a friday night and

0.0041699295	we purchased a
0.0041690654	i wouldn't be able to
0.0041690654	i wish we could
0.0041690654	a little slice of
0.0041678165	the music and the
0.0041644196	to ask how we
0.0041632044	this place to others
0.0041590323	was just enough for
0.0041590323	you are in the mood for

0.0041585479	him to take
0.0041545901	enough to let
0.0041541879	to find someone
0.0041521915	and i was quite
0.0041521915	tried most of the
0.0041521915	was not quite as
0.0041521915	they said they were
0.0041521915	you will love this
0.0041519745	and was told it would
0.0041519745	out of your way for
0.0041517789	20 minutes after we

0.0041484176	just not as good
0.0041450346	go back next time

0.0041430394	a passion for

0.0041400293	do anything for
0.0041344259	to charge you
0.0041337926	is by far one of my

0.0041273825	tried a variety of
0.0041273825	us a chance to
0.0041273825	wasn't impressed with the
0.0041273825	you are trying
0.0041244749	was slightly better
0.0041242689	something to do
0.0041227529	there are better places to
0.0041227529	took me here for
0.0041223320	itself has a
0.0041206443	you have more than
0.0041206443	had a cup of
0.0041199656	if you want to go
0.0041199656	i would order this
0.0041199656	to ask for more
0.0041199656	to find a good
0.0041199656	most of the other
0.0041199656	a bit of an
0.0041199656	so i tried it
0.0041176052	because we couldn't
0.0041174648	considering the quality of
0.0041171423	the sauce that came with
0.0041171423	you may have a
0.0041171423	don't have time for
0.0041151276	a little expensive for
0.0041146357	full price for
0.0041127429	who served us was
0.0041127429	2 for $
0.0041117239	we started out
0.0041080138	i expected a little
0.0041050193	to come here because
0.0041038135	able to make a
0.0041029923	we waited for about
0.0041029923	and i dined here
0.0041029923	what they could
0.0041029923	by the name
0.0041029923	been to both
0.0040983627	what seemed like a
0.0040979418	of those people
0.0040973560	was prompt and
0.0040973560	to relax and
0.0040959216	i can't say enough about this

0.0040936173	been here several times and
0.0040930946	was awesome as well
0.0040930946	he came over and
0.0040930946	about how good
0.0040927593	i've tasted in
0.0040921423	i almost always get the
0.0040911728	we probably should
0.0040908022	although i didn't
0.0040899978	and we were seated at
0.0040899978	and i decided to give
0.0040899978	and we didn't have to
0.0040899978	to say it was
0.0040899978	and this is one
0.0040899978	is always good and
0.0040899978	a party of 8 and
0.0040857220	those people that
0.0040857220	her birthday and
0.0040857159	have been here twice and
0.0040857159	around the corner from my
0.0040857159	his way to
0.0040857159	although i am not
0.0040853471	to charge me
0.0040853471	he seems to
0.0040851280	enough to get
0.0040831430	we ate here for
0.0040826022	since my first
0.0040781563	i don't really know
0.0040779923	my way through the
0.0040779923	i'd say it was
0.0040777398	never been there
0.0040767336	would definitely recommend this
0.0040767336	only complaint i had
0.0040767336	2 hours for a
0.0040738199	also ordered some
0.0040692271	is always busy and

0.0040681278	with a shot of
0.0040675180	was so delicious that
0.0040667765	whole time we
0.0040667765	good to pass up
0.0040667765	we could sit at
0.0040667765	when we first got
0.0040667765	i might give it
0.0040667765	what we were looking
0.0040667765	could tell they were
0.0040656974	so be prepared to
0.0040656974	very pleased with the
0.0040656974	take away from the
0.0040656974	in a thick
0.0040649978	which is one of the
0.0040649978	this time we had
0.0040627836	was charged for
0.0040613256	i guess if you
0.0040589804	got an order of
0.0040573327	were cold and
0.0040568849	i'd give this
0.0040540316	the remainder of the
0.0040540316	i think you should
0.0040540316	$ 15 for a
0.0040540316	came with two
0.0040540316	to fill you up
0.0040540316	this restaurant has been
0.0040539588	much going on
0.0040537313	but after a few
0.0040523434	was delicious as always
0.0040517336	be prepared for that
0.0040517336	took an hour and
0.0040512046	i've been here several times and
0.0040512046	and don't forget the
0.0040512046	i could tell that
0.0040512046	keep up the
0.0040512046	made sure to
0.0040508514	a great value for
0.0040499963	a seat at the bar and
0.0040475357	with salami and
0.0040473219	there are better places in
0.0040473219	always wanted to try this
0.0040473219	would have given this
0.0040473219	must try if you
0.0040473219	find out if
0.0040437212	were in the mood for
0.0040437212	not the best in the
0.0040437212	very disappointed in the
0.0040437212	for the kids to
0.0040437212	we weren't in a
0.0040437212	is the reason for
0.0040437212	we could have a
0.0040437212	but i don't think i
0.0040437212	is a good place to
0.0040437212	it is not on the
0.0040437212	other restaurants in the
0.0040437212	i could taste was
0.0040437212	while i was in
0.0040437212	were probably the best
0.0040437212	you don't get the
0.0040410734	he offered to
0.0040396154	and they're always
0.0040387160	to come back for more
0.0040387160	had a taste of the
0.0040381401	could ask for
0.0040381063	was so much better

0.0040350670	there last night for
0.0040324886	the potential to be

0.0040260692	if i were in the
0.0040260692	ask for it on the

0.0040166942	the chicken on the
0.0040166942	is not to be
0.0040166942	but it was a good
0.0040166942	i must say it was
0.0040166942	this place is going to
0.0040166942	and the service was very
0.0040166942	to choose from on the
0.0040166942	even though it was a
0.0040166942	and the food is so
0.0040166942	as good as i had
0.0040166942	it was delicious as well

0.0040127093	but i was so

0.0040056552	we've never had a

0.0040050913	i'd come back for
0.0040050913	they brought out some
0.0040050913	make it better
0.0040020983	to give this place another try
0.0040016790	that it was an
0.0040016790	i am going to have
0.0040016790	from all over the

0.0039960427	and he said that
0.0039960427	and have eaten at
0.0039943849	a little steep for
0.0039924733	to figure it out

0.0039924733	with a pitcher of
0.0039924733	was fine with me
0.0039924733	just wanted to get
0.0039924733	the only reason i gave this
0.0039924733	to heat it up
0.0039923040	it was a bit of a
0.0039923040	it was some of the best
0.0039923040	and i have to say it
0.0039923040	and i had to ask
0.0039923040	but the food is so
0.0039923040	and i didn't want to
0.0039923040	and the food was really
0.0039923040	we were one of the
0.0039923040	and i will be going

0.0039923040	was good and i
0.0039923040	the bread on the
0.0039923040	but not for a
0.0039923040	this time i was

0.0039923040	the pasta in the
0.0039923040	and a choice of
0.0039923040	and we didn't even
0.0039923040	and we enjoyed the
0.0039923040	that i would like
0.0039923040	and the bruschetta is
0.0039923040	we had to be
0.0039923040	and tasty and the
0.0039923040	this place is one of the
0.0039923040	and there was a lot of
0.0039923040	and the perfect amount of
0.0039923040	when i asked for the
0.0039923040	i like this place and
0.0039923040	and they give you a
0.0039923040	to get our food and

0.0039923040	and the sandwich was
0.0039923040	not very good and
0.0039923040	we would have to
0.0039923040	it was up to
0.0039923040	a good pizza and

0.0039844026	of many of the

0.0039844026	if your in the
0.0039844026	the place was almost
0.0039844026	even though the food was

0.0039844026	have to go to
0.0039844026	got there on

0.0039804177	and comes with a
0.0039804177	but i will say that
0.0039804177	and you will have
0.0039774473	we had room for
0.0039771085	has to be one of the
0.0039771085	but it is what it is
0.0039771085	as it used to be
0.0039771085	i would come back just
0.0039771085	my girlfriend and i were
0.0039771085	to give them a
0.0039771085	i know there are
0.0039771085	they now have a
0.0039771085	the little things that
0.0039771085	but they were out
0.0039771085	with my friend and
0.0039766790	it was much better than
0.0039766790	a little pricey for the
0.0039766790	but it was still a
0.0039766790	by the end of the
0.0039766790	that i didn't even
0.0039766790	of the bar and
0.0039766790	and had never been
0.0039766790	i think there is
0.0039766790	to come here for
0.0039766790	and the manager came
0.0039766790	the pasta with the
0.0039766790	to the bar for
0.0039766790	and asked if we had
0.0039766790	i had so much
0.0039761563	my husband and i had a
0.0039761563	as well as a few
0.0039754203	is so nice to
0.0039754203	a date or a
0.0039754203	good food at a
0.0039749735	i was blown away by the
0.0039749735	a step up from the
0.0039749735	this place is truly
0.0039749735	it's a shame that
0.0039749735	said she was
0.0039749735	he has had
0.0039708193	and the staff were
0.0039708193	but i think it
0.0039667300	to round out the
0.0039667300	there are some really
0.0039667300	but it wasn't anything
0.0039667300	too full to
0.0039659169	with butter and
0.0039659169	was hot and
0.0039658825	we will definitely be going
0.0039654632	to say it was the
0.0039654632	but it is worth the
0.0039654632	than made up for it
0.0039654632	is always good and the
0.0039654632	the waiter came to
0.0039654632	i have to tell
0.0039654632	by the amount of
0.0039654632	put it over the
0.0039654632	to stay in the
0.0039654632	if we were in the
0.0039654632	definitely give this place a
0.0039654632	i have been here many
0.0039654632	was going to give
0.0039654632	going to make a
0.0039654632	i will be sure
0.0039654632	were a bit over
0.0039654632	the dish was very
0.0039653329	3 4 of
0.0039653329	a few times now and
0.0039650760	the outside patio is
0.0039650760	you're looking for a
0.0039643840	i think it has
0.0039643840	but i don't see
0.0039643840	and they gave us a
0.0039643840	and had a wonderful time
0.0039643840	we also enjoyed the
0.0039643840	the consistency of the
0.0039643840	so we went for
0.0039643840	but it wouldn't be
0.0039643840	had a slice of
0.0039643840	but the texture was
0.0039643840	most of it was
0.0039630409	on the east side of
0.0039630409	would have gone to
0.0039628922	and all of us
0.0039625096	i'm not used to
0.0039623256	never had an
0.0039607807	there for lunch on
0.0039600123	this place for a while
0.0039600123	this place all the time
0.0039600123	this place is that they
0.0039600123	it was just the right
0.0039600123	to go on a
0.0039600123	you are at the
0.0039600123	here and we were
0.0039600123	i think there were
0.0039600123	i think that they
0.0039600123	we got was a
0.0039600123	the service was the best
0.0039600123	is the best in the
0.0039600123	of the meal were
0.0039600123	later and it was
0.0039600123	and we were looking
0.0039600123	we went there on
0.0039600123	if i could get
0.0039600123	going to go to
0.0039600123	definitely one of my
0.0039600123	the place was still

0.0039521085	just the way i
0.0039521085	in and out in
0.0039505833	i was pleasantly surprised with the
0.0039505833	but i wouldn't go back
0.0039505833	the only downside is the
0.0039505833	every time i am
0.0039505833	because it seems like
0.0039505833	we came here because
0.0039505833	for those who like
0.0039505833	which was just okay
0.0039505833	your looking for
0.0039505833	i had taken
0.0039505833	i especially enjoyed the
0.0039505833	to point out
0.0039501146	i know this place is
0.0039501146	but i would have liked
0.0039501146	but i was just
0.0039501146	think this place is
0.0039501146	was that they had
0.0039501146	for me and my
0.0039501146	the service was very friendly and
0.0039501146	it was not as
0.0039501146	had the salmon and
0.0039498913	i had a salad and
0.0039498913	this is the place to
0.0039498913	so if you have a
0.0039498913	i have only had the
0.0039498913	with the lack of
0.0039498913	i go for the
0.0039498913	the second time was
0.0039498913	the second time we
0.0039498913	the side of the
0.0039498913	of us were
0.0039498913	to make up
0.0039498913	my husband and i shared the
0.0039498913	the ingredients are fresh and the
0.0039498913	so we went to the
0.0039498913	if your looking for a
0.0039498913	about this place is the
0.0039498913	so we asked for
0.0039498913	because i wanted to
0.0039498913	it was packed with
0.0039498913	the music was so
0.0039498913	and we were very
0.0039498913	to talk to a
0.0039498913	and no one has
0.0039498913	but i find it
0.0039498913	but they were good
0.0039498913	the cheese was just
0.0039498913	the only one that
0.0039498913	of the evening was
0.0039498913	very fresh and the
0.0039498913	which was served with
0.0039498913	was the second time
0.0039498913	but the inside is
0.0039498913	think this is
0.0039472813	to stop here for
0.0039468810	which could be
0.0039460086	really wanted to like this
0.0039460086	it was about $
0.0039460086	a side of pasta with
0.0039460086	going to give it
0.0039458453	and a bottle of wine for
0.0039417300	when we went there
0.0039417300	the only problem is
0.0039414922	first time i went here
0.0039405163	and the noodles were
0.0039405163	the other day and
0.0039366336	but there are better
0.0039366336	we got out of
0.0039366336	is that we were
0.0039366336	when you get to
0.0039342663	i think it would be
0.0039322472	i think they should
0.0039322472	i'm sure there are
0.0039316422	and i really like the
0.0039316422	i think i had
0.0039313689	also had a few
0.0039313689	not want to be
0.0039313689	is the only way
0.0039313525	i would recommend this place to
0.0039311752	i used to be a
0.0039311752	but it was way too
0.0039311752	i think it had
0.0039311752	is very clean and
0.0039311752	i had been there
0.0039311752	i had to give
0.0039311752	has a bit of
0.0039311752	for our drinks and
0.0039311752	had to go to the
0.0039311752	and we were both very
0.0039311752	it was actually a
0.0039311752	i never had a
0.0039285582	it was worth every
0.0039285582	a pain in the
0.0039285582	here to celebrate my
0.0039255833	take your time and
0.0039248913	off with the

0.0039227174	we usually get the
0.0039227174	to come back to
0.0039227174	and there wasn't a
0.0039227174	for a glass of
0.0039227174	and it was quite good
0.0039227174	i thought it was just
0.0039227174	and i always have
0.0039176052	she was having
0.0039156501	someone to come
0.0039155502	so i was excited to

0.0039155502	is the only way to
0.0039155502	i finally went to
0.0039155502	to try some of
0.0039155502	but i don't really
0.0039148143	the woman at the
0.0039148143	were happy with our
0.0039148143	we also decided to
0.0039140654	i noticed they had
0.0039140654	haven't been here in a
0.0039140654	one of those places that
0.0039140654	second time here and
0.0039140654	you can tell by the
0.0039092663	and gave it to
0.0039092663	but they do have a
0.0039082246	and to top it all off
0.0039082246	and it was worth it
0.0039082246	i will be back for
0.0039082246	and there were plenty of
0.0039082246	and they were very good

0.0039082246	i didn't think that
0.0039082246	but we were all
0.0039082246	i think that was
0.0039082246	to be a little
0.0039082246	and the presentation was
0.0039082246	it up with the
0.0039082246	it is served with
0.0039082246	the food was delicious and the
0.0039082246	and my wife got the
0.0039082246	i had the salmon and
0.0039082246	but there were a few
0.0039082246	and the filling was
0.0039082246	and it wasn't even
0.0039082246	it had a good
0.0039082246	only because of the
0.0039082246	it came out with
0.0039082246	that they didn't have
0.0039082246	not that it was
0.0039082246	but they need to
0.0039082246	are huge and

0.0038736602	had a glass of wine and
0.0038736602	i make it a point to
0.0038736602	but this time it was
0.0038736602	in a place like this
0.0038736602	on my next visit to
0.0038736602	because it was so good
0.0038736602	like it used to be
0.0038736602	i went here for a
0.0038736602	i was not impressed with
0.0038736602	seems to have a
0.0038736602	so it must be
0.0038736602	that was served with
0.0038736602	find a place that
0.0038736602	since i am a
0.0038736602	they brought me a
0.0038736602	said that it was
0.0038736602	to know about
0.0038736602	to have something
0.0038736602	is just as good as
0.0038736602	we came here for a
0.0038736602	didn't live up to the
0.0038736602	not at all what
0.0038736602	was good enough to
0.0038648069	i liked that they
0.0038648069	the salads were good
0.0038648069	have to ask
0.0038648069	as if it were
0.0038645692	would go back to try
0.0038645692	if we could be
0.0038618847	you can tell they
0.0038618847	because we didn't
0.0038585479	with peas and
0.0038553241	it is easy to
0.0038553241	better than some of the
0.0038553241	came here with a
0.0038516351	i can't wait to get back
0.0038516351	and i finally got
0.0038486602	but not worth the
0.0038486602	i just wasn't
0.0038455676	or any of the
0.0038440014	was listed as
0.0038412714	is far better
0.0038371423	the food just wasn't
0.0038371423	i am going to try
0.0038371423	go wrong with any of the
0.0038371423	i love the fact that they
0.0038371423	it was more than enough for
0.0038371423	but definitely not the best
0.0038303241	i came here with my
0.0038303241	to give this place a
0.0038303241	was not good at all
0.0038303241	i wasn't impressed with the
0.0038303241	i want to try their
0.0038303241	i was able to get
0.0038303241	as if they are
0.0038223320	didn't make me
0.0038203022	unless you want to
0.0038195260	and we had a great time

0.0038121423	for the main course i had
0.0038107784	to see him
0.0037795862	and then proceeded to
0.0037666255	so i can get
0.0037597620	it's a nice place to
0.0037491195	because it seems
0.0037351742	more than a few
0.0037235461	is a great addition to
0.0037006915	i'll start with the
0.0037006915	my girlfriend got the
0.0037001159	make it myself
0.0036966730	the chef does
0.0036950010	and it was just a

0.0035178999	i'm not trying to
0.0035061765	really liked their
0.0034884881	made it difficult to
0.0034739638	probably because they
0.0034607220	went above and beyond to
0.0034578082	to dig in
0.0034517789	those looking for
0.0034501124	is actually pretty good
0.0034455705	down the road from

0.0034363256	been there many times and
0.0034363256	it off our bill
0.0034363256	even though i didn't
0.0034363256	a bunch of people
0.0034312751	welcome from the
0.0034273887	both were quite
0.0034240327	i would stay away
0.0034207006	when they brought it
0.0034118802	a staple for
0.0034117017	to hear about
0.0034115651	to give it a go
0.0034001098	best meatballs i
0.0033996425	got lucky and
0.0033968776	but not particularly
0.0033932246	i can't say the same
0.0033932246	the place looks like
0.0033913283	a bunch of other
0.0033903976	she said they were
0.0033903976	they do take
0.0033903976	she could not
0.0033903976	i was alone
0.0033903976	it was surprisingly good
0.0033903976	were never empty and
0.0033903976	he took my
0.0033881052	able to try
0.0033874838	not a huge fan of their
0.0033853471	where everything is
0.0033844848	part of the whole
0.0033840175	it is tucked away
0.0033827630	you order your
0.0033819280	do not know if
0.0033819280	the point where we
0.0033790340	i look forward to trying the
0.0033790340	but once we got
0.0033783996	as you sit down
0.0033757196	work on their
0.0033750428	i did not know what
0.0033750428	to take half of
0.0033702687	so much better than the
0.0033702307	to replace it
0.0033693020	only eat one
0.0033657737	was decent enough
0.0033639001	the friendliness of
0.0033639001	the conclusion that
0.0033620062	our bill came out
0.0033600946	we started off with an
0.0033592033	a party of three
0.0033541879	the difference between a
0.0033541879	to lick the
0.0033541818	to give them another
0.0033541818	people waiting to be
0.0033541818	with the perfect amount
0.0033541818	was every bit as
0.0033541818	i could give them
0.0033541818	been here at least
0.0033541818	there were four of
0.0033541818	see if they have
0.0033541818	going back for sure
0.0033541818	which was supposed to
0.0033541818	have no problem with
0.0033541818	on a recommendation from
0.0033540094	to fill our
0.0033536770	were nice enough
0.0033510379	the quality of the food was
0.0033510124	yet to try
0.0033494609	to wait more than
0.0033424383	my girlfriend and i came
0.0033360000	have nothing bad to say
0.0033360000	was very excited to try

0.0033350123	had the ravioli and
0.0033350123	and asked for our

0.0032474176	the fact that i was
0.0032474176	was very tasty and the
0.0032474176	i have been in the

0.0032284782	is a great place for a
0.0032284782	good and the service was good

0.0032284782	a good spot for
0.0032284782	not really worth the

0.0032284782	to check in on
0.0032284782	was hoping for a
0.0032284782	just not up to

0.0032284225	not trying to be
0.0032284225	which was fresh and
0.0032284225	but it's still a
0.0032284225	that he was going to
0.0032284225	it was a bit too
0.0032284225	to the point where we

0.0032284225	can get a little
0.0032284225	this is such a
0.0032284225	they also have an

0.0030177046	and a glass of wine for
0.0030166942	that i was a
0.0030166942	a restaurant on the
0.0030166942	i went in to
0.0030166942	when we asked for a
0.0030166942	and it was one of
0.0030166942	the food to come out
0.0030166942	so we asked for the
0.0030166942	we were seated on the
0.0030166942	and i usually go
0.0030166942	it was enough for
0.0030166942	the concept of the
0.0030166942	the decor was a
0.0030166942	which was such a
0.0030166942	of the pasta and
0.0030166942	and my wife got
0.0030166942	had the pizza and
0.0030166942	to see that it
0.0030166942	that it had been
0.0030166942	to try out a
0.0030166942	we had so much
0.0030166942	the fact that we were

0.0030166942	was really good and i
0.0030166942	with the cheese and
0.0030166942	so we asked the
0.0030166942	was good and we
0.0030166942	this place because it
0.0030166942	i ate here with
0.0030166942	first time there and
0.0030166942	to ask them to
0.0030166942	a salad and it
0.0030166942	but there is something
0.0030166942	are huge and the
0.0030166942	to go there for
0.0030166942	that i have no

0.0030138143	to have dinner at
0.0030120106	from here again
0.0030114296	is the only place i
0.0030114296	is so rich and

0.0030056552	almost always get the
0.0030056552	be back next time
0.0030050913	but not nearly as
0.0030050913	that they serve with
0.0030050913	it's hard to find a
0.0030050913	with a pile of
0.0030050913	cause i was
0.0030050913	because it seemed
0.0030025416	could have been an

0.0029844026	and we loved the
0.0029844026	to bring us a
0.0029844026	the bread that they
0.0029844026	we only had to

0.0029600123	it had been a
0.0029600123	one of these in
0.0029600123	we were in for
0.0029600123	as if they had
0.0029600123	as i used to
0.0029600123	i thought there was
0.0029600123	is so fresh and
0.0029600123	were so fresh and
0.0029600123	a place where i
0.0029600123	i came in for
0.0029600123	for me as i
0.0029600123	came in with a
0.0029600123	is always friendly and
0.0029600123	our meal with a
0.0029600123	as it could be
0.0029600123	that they do not
0.0029600123	don't care for the
0.0029600123	in any of the
0.0029600123	that we could have
0.0029600123	was very slow and
0.0029600123	it back to the
0.0029600123	and the pasta with
0.0029600123	but i would probably
0.0029600123	of us in the
0.0029600123	but it is very
0.0029600123	and were quite
0.0029600123	my husband and i had the
0.0029600123	this is a good place to
0.0029600123	a party of 6 and
0.0029600123	we did not have to
0.0029600123	that it would be a
0.0029600123	i was hoping for a
0.0029600123	and the service was just
0.0029600123	that you don't have to
0.0029600123	was supposed to be a
0.0029600123	but it was nice to
0.0029600123	which is one of my
0.0029600123	i have to give it
0.0029600123	for the quality of the
0.0029600123	and the food is just
0.0029600123	were very pleased with the
0.0029600123	that this was the best
0.0029600123	i think it was just
0.0029600123	it was way too much
0.0029600123	was very good and i
0.0029600123	to listen to the
0.0029600123	are always fresh and
0.0029600123	but if you get
0.0029600123	it is not as
0.0029600123	it was not good
0.0029600123	and they have all
0.0029600123	the lasagna and the
0.0029600123	know what it is
0.0029600123	it wasn't going to
0.0029600123	the pasta had a
0.0029600123	to come by and
0.0029600123	that was more than
0.0029600123	very nice and i
0.0029600123	was good and had
0.0029600123	my friends had the
0.0029600123	had to use the
0.0029600123	were pretty good but
0.0029600123	and the bread that
0.0029600123	seem to have a
0.0029600123	with a plate of
0.0029600123	for us to go
0.0029600123	i went in for
0.0029600123	at the front was
0.0029600123	i didn't get a
0.0029600123	but the taste of
0.0029600123	me that it was
0.0029600123	the menu and was
0.0029600123	we had such a
0.0029600123	went here on the
0.0029600123	of any of the
0.0029600123	one thing that i
0.0029600123	so i gave it
0.0029600123	think it was a
0.0029600123	i was not in
0.0029600123	was that we were
0.0029600123	had to have a
0.0029600123	when i got to
0.0029600123	not too thin and
0.0029600123	because it is not
0.0029600123	so we didn't have
0.0029600123	i make it a
0.0029600123	and brought out a
0.0029600123	even have to
0.0029600123	going here for
0.0029600123	would like it
0.0029600123	of the wine and
0.0029600123	they bring you a
0.0029600123	it was really really
0.0029568747	if you're not in
0.0029526455	while i'm not a
0.0029526455	always had a good
0.0029521085	i would have given it
0.0029505833	that was less than
0.0029505833	everything about this
0.0029505833	an even more
0.0029505833	i am so glad we
0.0029505833	but i probably wouldn't
0.0029501146	i think i can
0.0029498913	but that is just
0.0029498913	i will go back for
0.0029498913	just so i could
0.0029498913	i really like this
0.0029498913	i guess that is
0.0029498913	was so fresh and
0.0029498913	when we went to
0.0029498913	i can say is
0.0029498913	probably one of the
0.0029498913	the table next to us was
0.0029498913	i was very happy with the
0.0029498913	i don't know if they
0.0029498913	it used to be a
0.0029498913	was just as good
0.0029498913	with all the other
0.0029498913	everything was fresh and
0.0029498913	i was there with
0.0029498913	had to wait for
0.0029498913	but i won't be
0.0029498913	with an order of
0.0029498913	was more like a
0.0029498913	seemed to have a
0.0029498913	not one of them
0.0029498913	don't like it
0.0029498913	we were going
0.0029498913	is definitely not

0.0029472813	time i go in
0.0029472672	is part of the
0.0029460086	been to a few
0.0029460086	to go back to try
0.0029460086	best i've had in
0.0029460086	in all i will
0.0029460086	know that this is
0.0029460086	if we were in
0.0029410729	to this restaurant again
0.0029410729	get in and out
0.0029410729	get a side
0.0029406304	a candle to
0.0029342663	this is a very good
0.0029342663	they are so good
0.0029342663	i have been here twice and
0.0029342663	all of it is
0.0029342663	this place could be
0.0029337537	i was seated at
0.0029316422	and the ravioli was
0.0029316422	and so much more
0.0029316422	the pizza was very good and
0.0029316422	and i have always
0.0029313689	are going for
0.0029313525	the rest of the menu is
0.0029311752	it down to a
0.0029311752	i also love that
0.0029311752	i will definitely come back to
0.0029311752	was a great way to
0.0029311752	here with a group of
0.0029311752	was going to get
0.0029311752	but i did like
0.0029311752	the lasagna was good
0.0029311752	have never had a
0.0029311752	we were all very
0.0029311752	the prices were very
0.0029311752	this place does it
0.0029311752	try to make it
0.0029311752	from a place that
0.0029311752	it wouldn't be a
0.0029311752	after we ordered it
0.0029311752	about half of the
0.0029311752	for what i got
0.0029311752	i was happy to
0.0029311752	but not quite as
0.0029311752	if it wasn't so
0.0029311752	the table next to us had
0.0029311752	i was very disappointed in
0.0029311752	which was tasty but
0.0029311752	have to try it
0.0029311752	we were offered a
0.0029306005	i think it's a
0.0029306005	so i called and
0.0029255833	had some kind of
0.0029248913	we went for lunch and
0.0029248913	but that is not
0.0029248913	i went with my
0.0029248913	really like it
0.0029160172	was really tasty and
0.0029160172	that they were out of
0.0029155502	that is part of
0.0029155502	i was excited to try it
0.0029155502	is probably one of the best
0.0029155502	on the recommendation of a
0.0029148143	so we gave it
0.0029092663	here for the first time
0.0029092663	was one of the most
0.0029092663	it's not the best
0.0029092663	have to try the
0.0029092663	the 2 of us
0.0029092663	comes in a
0.0029082246	and it turned out to be
0.0029082246	i will definitely be back to
0.0029082246	that they did not
0.0029082246	this is probably the
0.0029082246	but not as good as the
0.0029082246	it was light and
0.0029082246	very close to the
0.0029082246	was very flavorful and
0.0029082246	but that is what
0.0029082246	and really liked it
0.0029082246	that i have found
0.0029082246	was my first
0.0029082246	get into the
0.0029082246	but my favorite was the
0.0029082246	but i found it
0.0029066791	been looking for a
0.0029043419	it was an off
0.0029043419	rather go to a
0.0029043419	are going to get
0.0029043419	think it was like
0.0029043419	we were here on
0.0029037780	we were able to get a
0.0029037780	and it is definitely
0.0029037780	it isn't the best
0.0029037780	come up with a
0.0029037780	this is where you
0.0029037780	a good day
0.0028892852	wish they had a
0.0028892852	went with my
0.0028892852	for a place like this
0.0028892852	we each got a
0.0028892852	for a while before
0.0028892852	i may have to
0.0028892852	so i'll have to
0.0028892852	have to give
0.0028892852	is made from
0.0028881530	is a nice little
0.0028881530	to put it on
0.0028881530	it was also a
0.0028881530	it lived up to the
0.0028881530	there seems to be a
0.0028881530	this was just a
0.0028881530	i had my first
0.0028881530	they were good but
0.0028881530	a sign of a
0.0028854025	had to try this
0.0028853471	to find anything
0.0028832246	but nothing to
0.0028829381	was blown away by the
0.0028829381	if you find yourself in
0.0028736602	but not the best i've had
0.0028736602	we will not be
0.0028736602	and this was just
0.0028736602	i did not know
0.0028736602	i would definitely go back to
0.0028736602	i would not recommend this
0.0028736602	with a good amount of
0.0028736602	this place would be a
0.0028736602	to a restaurant that
0.0028736602	was very rude and
0.0028736602	i also tried a
0.0028736602	the attention of the
0.0028736602	which is always a
0.0028736602	i will never go back to
0.0028736602	that will make you
0.0028735295	the point where
0.0028645692	to try that next
0.0028645692	not what i was
0.0028645692	this place is as good
0.0028585479	goes by and
0.0028585479	give him a
0.0028223320	given them a
0.0026996425	they're going to
0.0026541879	able to take
0.0025853471	can't remember the name of
0.0025042668	had the following
0.0024884881	the hype is about
0.0024480899	is cozy and
0.0024409768	would have had to
0.0024406304	were hungry so
0.0024363256	we checked out the
0.0024363256	the only negative was
0.0024363256	back the next day
0.0024363256	were staying at the
0.0024363256	because they didn't have
0.0024363256	was very well done
0.0024363256	placed in the
0.0024363256	me know that
0.0024340332	tried some of
0.0024334119	be ready to
0.0024274346	but that's about
0.0024115651	it was super good
0.0024001098	was surprised to see that
0.0024001098	would definitely come back here
0.0024001098	been wanting to try this
0.0024001098	take a date or
0.0024001098	were waiting for our
0.0023946590	i would have preferred a
0.0023946590	more than i could
0.0023933259	did have a
0.0023927046	get a bottle of wine and
0.0023927046	a bit of a wait for
0.0023903976	probably due to the
0.0023903976	to compensate for the
0.0023903976	if you are staying at the
0.0023903976	with a mixture of
0.0023903976	the concierge at the
0.0023903976	who came in
0.0023903976	would give it
0.0023903976	the only reason i am
0.0023903976	i will definitely return to
0.0023903976	was fantastic as well
0.0023903976	next time you are
0.0023903976	after reading all the
0.0023881052	through all of
0.0023874838	had leftovers for
0.0023874838	the corner from
0.0023874838	we moved on
0.0023874838	a smile on
0.0023874838	was rubbery and
0.0023874838	a difference in
0.0023874838	was excited to
0.0023874838	a seat at
0.0023844848	make sure to make
0.0023757196	the only reason i am not
0.0023757196	we were ready for
0.0023757196	could have gone to
0.0023757196	don't know if they
0.0023757196	very impressed with this
0.0023702687	i was less than
0.0023702687	and my daughter had
0.0023702687	1 4 of the
0.0023668286	when there are so many
0.0023668286	never had better
0.0023668286	to make sure everything
0.0023660074	but i wouldn't go
0.0023609858	this place must be
0.0023609858	a little expensive but
0.0023609858	a break from the
0.0023609858	but everything else is
0.0023600946	don't know if it's
0.0023600946	this review because i
0.0023600946	if you check in
0.0023600946	i'm usually not a
0.0023541818	after reading some of the
0.0023541818	have been eating here
0.0023487991	the price is not
0.0023487309	very nice as well
0.0023467766	the rest of the food was
0.0023360000	it's been a long time
0.0023360000	was no longer on

0.0023350123	it off with a
0.0023350123	i went there on
0.0023350123	which is usually a
0.0023350123	the difference in the
0.0023350123	do not have the
0.0023350123	we did have to
0.0023350123	this is always a
0.0023350123	which i was not
0.0023350123	the layout of the
0.0023350123	and the sauce was very
0.0023350123	went to this place for
0.0023350123	my family and i had
0.0023350123	we went here for a
0.0023350123	this was by far the
0.0023350123	i walked in to
0.0023350123	get back to the
0.0023350123	a place to get
0.0023350123	for our table of

0.0023350123	way back to
0.0023350123	got back to
0.0023350123	was probably one of the best
0.0023350123	was ok but not
0.0023297915	i have tried most
0.0023297915	had run out of
0.0023297915	since the last time
0.0023297915	to hang out at
0.0023297915	is by far my
0.0023297915	not to fill up
0.0023297915	a 3 course
0.0023297915	saw they had
0.0023297915	as long as i can
0.0023297915	made us feel like we
0.0023297915	is tucked away in a
0.0023297915	was nothing more than
0.0023297915	you don't need to
0.0023297915	i would prefer to
0.0023297915	there several times and
0.0023297915	to go ahead and
0.0023297915	was very pleased with
0.0023297915	i'm sure i will

0.0022933456	was really good and the
0.0022933456	which made it a

0.0022890843	it was just as good
0.0022890843	to find a place that
0.0022890843	is right next to the
0.0022890843	everyone was friendly and
0.0022890843	was a great value

0.0022890843	i thought it was a little
0.0022890843	which turned out to be a
0.0022890843	i am going to be
0.0022890843	but the food is just
0.0022890843	so much so that we
