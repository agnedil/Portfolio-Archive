This place is great for fish and chips. They have beer battered halibut in addition to the standard cod. This is what I usually order since I enjoy it so much, especially since it is almost impossible to find anyone who uses halibut for fish & chips. The other items on the menu are decent enough, we have never had a bad meal here. 
I wanted to give it a higher rating but they recently changed the menu up a bit, instead of raising their prices, they made the portions smaller for the same price. This bugs me. You used to get 3 large pieces of fish for $12.99, now you get 2 medium sized pieces. 
Service is ok, have had better but have had worse.
This place is great!   I've never had a bad meal here.  The clam chowder is some of the best that I've ever had.  Tonight I had the crab legs.  My husband had lemon dill crusted orange roughy.  It was one of the best fish dishes that I have ever tried.
This used to be the best, a little pricey, but delicious when they were located by Fiesta Mall.  But, now it's just overpriced small portions which are still very good tasting.  You pretty much need to order 2 fish and chip dinners to get 1 good meal which makes the price absolutely ridiculous.  Another great classic food joint that moved into an expensive lease and now can't remember what made them successful.  Too bad.
In what used to be home to the Sloppy Lobster (or something like that), this little seafood market made its new home.

Went out on a limb to make sushi at home (yes, experimental) one weekend and figured I'd try the place. I knew nothing going in.

The manager on staff was super helpful, pointing out customer favorites, as well as his own.  He gave us some squid slaw samples that I wouldn't touch, but the girlfriend threw it in the fridge and I don't think it's moved yet.  Oops.  She loved it.

Anyway, he gave us a few top choices for which type of fish to include and what would fit in a decent budget.  Went home with 3 different types of seafood for sushi.

The sushi experiment itself was messy, but delicious.  $30 worth of fish fed 8 hungry people.  Not bad, when compared to the 200+ you'd spend for that same group out at any other sushi restaurant.  Get your hands dirty, make some sushi from this place, save some dough.

This place also has a counter where you can order fried seafood and sandwiches to go, all priced reasonably cheap.  Will be back to try it.
Best source of seafood in town. Great quality and very knowledgable staff.  Our go to place for all things seafood.  They also have some great soups and takeout meals.
Stopped by while in from out of town. Dad and I got cod sandwich, seared tuna sandwich, and clam chowder. We split all three items.

Sandwiches were very good. Nice teriyaki type sauce on the Tuna, and cod was perfectly crispy. Rolls served on weren't too much or too little. 

Clam chowder was good but didn't have enough clam. It was basically potato chowder.

Service was excellent. Staff checked with us multiple times and even refilled my water. Doesnt sound like much, but this place is more of a seafood market than it is a lunch sit down establishment. Regardless, they treated us well and I'd be back again.
Great selection of fresh seafood and seafood dishes. Everything is marked clearly, so you can tell what was frozen, farm-raised, etc. Stop in for the fried Daily Catch, Cod or Salmon for the tastiest fish you'll eat in town. The counter staff is friendly and helpful. There is a stand up/bar stool area for eating there, but no comfortable sit down tables.
The staff is always friendly, very knowledgeable. Great selection and quality seafood.
Great and very fresh wide selection of seafood.  Tim behind the counter is ver y helpful.  They have all sorts of seafood flown in from everywhere.. crabs from Maryland, oysters from the east and california.. sushi grade tuna and salmon.  I'll visit this place every time I'm in Madison.
Do you like seafood? SEE FOOD! No, but seriously. If you love fresh fish but you're not in the mood for trout, blue gill, and other local freshwater species, Seafood Center is where it's at. Located in an unassuming strip mall (like so many other gems in Madison), I was greeted by friendly employees and two display cases bursting with clams, salmon, wahoo, mussels, crab, shrimp, and even some Dabob oysters! I nabbed some wild Alaskan halibut for only $16.99 a pound--sometimes this is a steal even in my hometown of Seattle.

I perused the "to-go" menu of various fried treats and chatted with the owner. Upon hearing that I was new to town, he said he wanted to do for me what someone did for him when he first moved to Madison. He wrote down a list of a few hidden gems--specialty food stores--that I should check out. Score! All in all, in the land-locked Midwest, Seafood Center reminds me that it's a small world after all and a taste of home is just a plane ride away (in a refrigerated case of halibut).
One of the best seafood markets in Madison, with competitive prices.  The rating is based on available options in the Madison area - this isn't Pike Place or anything.

They have both frozen and fresh seafood with a very nice selection.  They carry the standards, like salmon, various whitefish, shrimp, scallops, live and frozen lobster, crab legs, etc., but also have some of the harder to find items like sashimi grade tuna, opa, blue marlin, skate wing, swordfish, prawns, clams, and oysters.  I think they're the only place in Madison that carries Laughing Bird shrimp.

Now I can't guarantee that they'll have everything listed there when you go, as they do have somewhat of a rotating inventory based on availability and fishing seasons, but I've always been able to special order something if they didn't have it.

Monday through Saturday, they also have carry out, if you're looking for some fried catfish, or shrimp, or cod, or calamari - that kind of thing - check out their website for a menu: http://www.madseafood.com/Carryout.nxg    They also have smoked fish available.  There is no seating, pick up only.

There's other seafood-related sundries there too, like marinades, sauces, breading, spices, and sides if you need ideas on preparing the main dish.

The staff is very knowledgeable, and can help you with recipe, cooking, and pairing questions.  They'll also skin the fish for you too if you ask.

They have an Old Sauk road location (which I think has some tables if you're looking to eat there) and a satellite in the Willy St. Co-op, but I prefer the Whitney Way store - if only for familiarity's sake.
Go there for the Fish n Chips! Yeah, I know, they have have fresh seafood and all that but I go there for the fried kind. Depending on what type of fish you get it will run you $6-$7 and you get some nicely cooked fish, chips, coleslaw and tartar.  Very consistent with the food and nice employee's to boot. 
They only do take-out and unless things have changed they don't do the chips on Sunday, They also have a tank full of lobsters to entertain you while they cook your order!
The best place to get good seafood in Madison.  The staff here (and their other locations) has always been very friendly and knowledgeable.  We go here for fresh oysters and sushi-grade fish among other things.  They also have a good carry out menu with mostly fried seafood.  Fish fry is good and the fried scallops and other shellfish are cooked perfectly.  Never chewy.
The first time we here was the first time we were making sushi at home and not only did we get great fish, we got a lot of advice about making rolls and a great recipe for a spicy tuna roll.
It is expensive, but its madison and until they start pulling tuna out of lake mendota, it will always cost more.
I saw this place rated highly on Yelp and had a hankering for some Fish and Chips so I headed on down there.  The place is small but they look to have a lot of great fresh seafood pickings.  My food was ready when I got there.  I wanted lunch and dinner so I got a shrimp fish and chips for lunch and a cod fish and chips for dinner, with a side of pasta salad and some New England clam chowder.  They were out of warm soup but I got the cold and re-heated.

Everything was superb, the shrimp was was large and the fish was very crisp and best of all, not greasy at all.  You'd hardly know it was fried in fact as it wasn't the least bit greasy and therefor didn't taste of grease at all (a common problem I've had at some places where I get fish and chips, greasiness=queasiness).  Fries were simply delicious, I usually throw some away as I'm not real big on french fries but none of these saw the trash can. The pasta salad was amazing and the soup was fantastic as well.  They also had a big basket of lemons of which I bought for desert (I love to eat raw lemons) and they were quite tasty too.

All in all it was about $30 for everything.  Not bad at all considering it was top quality and delicious and I got about 3 1/2 meals out of the whole thing.  A fantastic value.  I don't eat seafood like this alot but I'd eat here a ton if I was a Madison resident.  The only con I can think of is I'd like more of the chips (batter-not fries) like Long John Silvers gives you when you get their cheap fish.  Add that and this place would be absolutely perfect.  

Remember - carryout only!

NOTE: On my pic of the shrimp fish and chips dinner I did eat a piece of the shrimp before I took the pic so take that into consideration as to how much shrimp you actually get with the meal.
I stopped here based upon the good reviews and because a local Madison personality buys all his fish from here.   I was not disappointed.
Really good prices.   The carry out price is a great deal and the food was excellent on our first order.  Deep fried cod of large proportion, tender, moist, excellent breading and good flavor.   The tartar sauce was quite good and so was the coleslaw.   
I also ordered some lobster bisque and one smoked whitefish which I haven't tried yet.
Everyone behind the counter was engaged in helping customers and very nice.
We will be back.
They actually didn't have some fish I was looking for but I might be able to order it so I won't give them a negative for that.  Can I get Chilean Sea Bass or Branzini?  I suspect so.  later folks.
Worst cod sandwich I've ever tried to eat... I gave my dog the rest.
Gave them a 2nd chance, tried the "sampler" well, it beat the hell out of the cod sandwich...

My Dad became really sick after eating here based on either food poisoning or some sort of virus from improper hand washing..
We only checked this place out because of the other positive reviews on Yelp, and I'm glad we did...

We had the Cod basket and Shrimp basket, both came with tatar/cocktail sauce, fries and coleslaw.  Each were cooked to order, so there was a small wait but again worth it.

There is no dining-in, but we were happy eating in our car :)

Really reminds me of Hagens Fish market in Chicago (Portage Park)
Madison may as well be located in the high desert when it comes to QUALITY seafood... well, actually, that's not true - I've had some of the most amazing sashimi of my entire life while in Joshua Tree, California.  So much for that analogy.

But you get my point - Madison consumers don't have many options for fresh, quality fish, nor do we have a ton of knowledgable fish mongers to work with.

We do, however, have The Seafood Center!  And, holy catfish (sorry Angie from FTS), are these guys awesome!  

I felt like making fish tacos last night, so we fired-up Yelp and found a few recommendations for fresh seafood.  My first choice, "Seafood Center" on Junction Road closed on January 1.  In a panic, I raced over to this location and was relieved to find them open, and very busy.

The location is small, but don't let the size deter you - they are packed to the gills with fantastic fish.  There's also a kitchen in the back that offers a variety of deep fried piscine platters, but I was there for the uncooked stuff.

A super friendly monger asked if he could assist me with anything.  I told him I was planning to do some grilled fish tacos and was considering Halibut, Tilapia, or Mahi.

He immediately offered that they were out of Mahi, and that he only had about half-a-pound of Halibut left.  The Tilapia, while farmed, was fresh and would be "fine" for a taco.  He then suggested I check out the Corvina - it had arrived earlier in the day, was line caught, and would be superb for grilling.  He offered me a smell of the fish - it was completely odorless - the whole shop is odorless, in fact - and that's a good sign when shopping for fish.

I took 1.25 pounds of the Corvina - he skinned it for me, wrapped it in plastic, put it on ice, and presented me with the bounty.  I haven't had that kind of experience since I lived in San Francisco and Austin.

I will be back!!!  This place is truly incredible, and I hope Madison will continue to support this location.  If you're looking for some awesome seafood, swing through The Seafood Center - it's definitely the real deal.

Oh - so how were the tacos?  Amazing!  I marinated the Corvina in lime, cilantro, jalapeno, and a splash of tequila, then grilled it on the Big Green Egg for about 9 minutes or so (at 400F).  Whipped-up some incredible spicy slaw, some black refried beans, and an amazing sauce.  A corn tortilla and a slice of avocado made for a stellar dinner.  

None of it would've been possible without the help of The Seafood Center (and Yelp)!
I've been here a few times and the food has been wonderful. I've only gotten the deep-fried cod with fries, but it's always delicious with tasty tartar and coleslaw on the side. 

Only thing keeping me from making this a five-star review is that it's served a little cold - could be hotter from the get-go.
great choices for fish. Madison may not be near the coast, but the Seafood Center offers some great fish.
The quality of the seafood here is great for the midwest (I'm from the east coast, so I am pretty picky about my fish). So that's not the reason they're getting a two-star review from me. 

The two-star review is because I ordered three pounds of shrimp for my annual Christmas party about a week before the party happened. They told me it would be no problem. 

Unfortunately they lost the order. When my husband went to pick it up, it was not ready and he waited over 30 minutes while they scrambled to find three pounds of shrimp.

If you're going to put yourself out there as providing catering platters for parties, then make sure you keep your orders straight. I'm not sure what I'll do next year, but I am definitely soured on the Seafood Center.
Awesome fish. I always get the catch of the day (variety of fried fish- from tuna to salmon to whitefish). It is phenomenal.  They also have a eide range of cooking supplies that go with seafood dishes.

 I have never made a bulk order so have not experienced any issues like some of the other reviews.
I didn't think this quality of seafood could be found here. I lived on the east coast and have gotten used to fresh seafood. This establishment did not disappoint.
We ordered a couple of sandwiches and some seafood for later. I ordered a grilled tuna and my wife ordered fried cod. It came on a nice roll and was cooked perfectly. The fish in both cases was allowed to be the star of the sandwich. Meaning it was not loaded down with sauce covering the flavor. We split an order of fries and they were very good as well. Only draw back, there is only one table with four chairs in the place but than it is not a restaurant.
Now, while this is a seafood store it does not have an over powering smell as such. It is clean, the staff was friendly and eager to assist. The seafood items are labeled with type and where it was harvested. It all looked incredible and fresh. We purchased some fresh sea scallops that required nothing more than to be cooked with some salt and pepper. They were sweet and tender and turned out incredible. We also purchased some mahi-mahi, it was very fresh and I would venture a guess that it had not been out of the water for a long time. It smelled very nice both raw and cooked.
This is a place we will be returning to often. The only problem will be what to purchase next time.
We were very disappointed in the take-out we bought tonight: clam chowder.  We expected more from a place that specializes in fish and seafood.  It had zero clam flavor (tasted mainly of uncooked flour), and the tiny bits of clams probably didn't add up to a full soup spoon in a whole pint of chowder.  We threw most of it out.
Got the fish and chips - replaced chips with onion rings.

Fluffy and finely spiced, fish was definitely tasty. Good batter. Good take away food.
-yay! they have one here
-was searching for ice cream
-didn't feel like having boba/halo-halo from red ribbon or jollibee
-didn't scope out the store much but it did appear to be the same size as the one in union city
-still no overpowering fish smell
-no scoops of ice cream but found mochi balls
-inline, got the slowest clerk....she needed to retire but she was so sweet
-"magandang hapon po..." i said (good afternoon)
-"ay, pilipina ka pala, akala ko hindi" (oh, i didn't think you were filipina)
="MAITIM KASI "(cuz i'm dark) AS SHE GIGGLES AND TAKES A YEAR TO WRAP UP
Live crabs in barrels! Whole fish! Gross weird things I have never seen!

I love this market. i used to live down the street and loved to pick up some yummy fishes and all sorts of noodles and whatever Asian spices smelled perfect for the night.

I had no idea what i was doing half the time but the ingredients made themselves.

The fish was all fresh and the whole store interesting. I don't think I am a fan of boba. I love this store I love this store. I love this store.
This place was good until it was well known in the asian community. You have to fight for a parking spot. It's waay crowded, the employees have somewhat of a lack of communication.

The positives of this place, it reminds me of home...the palenke (however you spell it) smell. The fish you can inspect yourself for freshness (I am picky when it comes to fish). Also I like the fact they can clean and cook it for you (for those who are always on the run).
The good things about Seafood City are that it's interesting, clean and bright.  I especially liked the seafood department.  The fish were just beautiful to look at.  They also had mutton and goat meat today.  I've always wanted to try mutton....The reason I didn't rate it higher was that they didn't have as many interesting things in the other areas of the store.  The produce section was nice, but a little unremarkable.  The frozen foods and grocery areas just didn't have as much unusual stuff as either 99 Ranch or Diho Market.
Real Rating is 4 STARS for the SEAFOOD
                           1 STARS for SERVICE at the seafood counter

 Here's the lowdown. This is the best place in Las Vegas for fresh seafood. They have a nice selection that rotates a lot. One week you can get Pompano, the next you can find Strawberry Grouper, after that... you get the picture. And the prices are fantastic. Farm-raised Salmon for half what the box grocery chains offer. 

Now here's the major problem. You take said fresh fish to the counter and you tell them, please scale this and gut this and leave the head and tail. When you pick it up, they have slashed off the tail, partially gutted it, and it still is chock full of scales. There is a big communication gap. You speak English, the guy at the counter speaks Tagalog, and the guy in the back speaks Spanish. And no one of you speaks any of the other languages. They have butchered at least one of the fish way beyond presentation EVERY time I've gone. And usually ALL of them more than once. So this is the absolute weakest link at this store. Period.

And Yeah, most customers and employees stare if you're not Asian. But they have a good selection of items from produce to bakery goods to the great fish, so get over it. Hell, I get mondo-stares because I don surgical gloves and really inspect my fish purchases. Now if I could only get THEM to prep the fish correctly!

And on the service end of it, the girls at the checkout counters have always been extremely nice. So don't worry about that aspect of it. This is a great place to find Asian items from Asians for Asians. Non-Asians just aren't part of their flow charts is all.
Seafood City Supermarket is my first choice grocery for specialty Filipino items and obviously for seafood. My only warning is that it's a stinky place. I don't do my bulk shopping here, but it is definitely a place I go to for something specific.
Good selection of filipino items and of course seafood. They have mostly anything you need thats asian. I used to go here a couple times a week when i lived in vegas because it was right down the street. I sure miss this place.
This placed scared the b-jesus outta me! When you first walk in it's like they have all these strange fast seafood set-ups to your left and right. Non of it looked very appealing. I felt like I was at walmart only with seafood. The floors looked dirty and the lighting was florescent and everything looked sort of green.
The live crabs had about 3 pieces of ice underneath and their eyes cut out. I sat and watched in dismay as customers (mostly bored, no intention to buy, teenagers) walked by and hit the live crabs with the tongs. I felt grossed out, sad, and without appetite by the time I turned around and left. 
I hope this place closes down, you really do get what you pay for and with seafood I wouldn't risk it anyway. Heading to Whole Foods for my tuna steaks from now on.
Once I got over just how crowded this place gets I had an absolute blast checking out the seafood selection! Live blue crabs (yes some of the little kids were smacking them on the shells with the tongs, but some of those crabs were fighting back!), a huge selection of fish including parrot fish, live catfish (and frozen), lobster, squid, shrimp, oysters, clams, etc etc. I spent a good 30 minutes just browsing around making little mental notes of the selection for later. I got there around 7 pm on a weekday and it was a tad crazy so I decided I'd come back at opening time the next day before things really got busy.

New opening hours though!! They seem to open at 8 am, not 9!! Wasn't too bad though, had my cart and was wandering around a bit, only occasionally running into the odd elderly grandma or child, lol. I had decided the night before to try my hand at some chioppino and had put together a list of some of the seafood I wanted to get. Ingredients bought were live blue crabs, some alaskan crab legs, clams, cherrystones clams, some squid, fresh shrimp, and some fish. Once you pick what you want and put it into a plastic bag (paper for the crabs) you get in line to have it weighed at the counter. Quick and friendly, and if you have some whole fish you can have it cleaned, gutted, and chopped up for you! Very convenient since I doubt I'd have been too successful at it. I still wish I could have had them do that with the squid, that stuff was nasty to do at home later (yet sooo worth it...yummy).  The fresh ingredients made ALL the difference in the chioppino, my wife was raving about the taste later.

If seafood isn't your thing though they also have a huge selection of pork/chicken/beef to choose from. Pork snout? Beef liver? They have it. Wonderful selection, even the frozen areas were fun to browse through! I saw a huge bag of frozen crawfish that was practically calling my name... mmm, maybe next time.
Unless you've been sequestered all your life in suburbia, Whole Foods, and other regular supermarkets, you might be a little overwhelmed with this seafood market (like Ms. H down below). But it's one of the best seafood markets in Las Vegas. 

It's in the heart of this so-called ghetto neighborhood and it caters to the Filipino and other Asian communities of Vegas. The market offers a variety of fresh produce, noodles, rice, and desserts. As for the seafood, if you're used to the pre-packaged fish fillets (like in Albertson's, Smiths) get used to looking at whole fish with head and tail in all. They offer several types of fish, squid, crab, and lobster. They even have my elusive seaweed salad! You can't get this stuff at Vons. 

On another note, it provides a little oasis for the Filipino community. There are Filipino fast food restaurants such as, Jollibee and Chowking. For all those who are homesick. I wouldn't advise eating here though, the food is laden with MSG and grease. And it's so not worth paying that $9.00 for a meal! Also, since it's the only major Filipino market, it gets really crowded. So go in the early mornings to avoid crowds, you can also get first dibs on seafood!
As mentioned in other reviews, this place can get really busy. The place was swarming with asians. The only white person in the whole place was my wife. They've got a wide variety of stuff you'd never find at Smith's or Vons. Fruits and veggies that I've never even heard of and a lot of their produce (the stuff that you have heard of) is much cheaper than at the big name grocery stores. If you're looking for asian ingredients this is the place to go. The seafood section is like something straight out of San Francisco -- piles and piles of whole fish and crabs on ice. It's not something that you would expect to find in Vegas. If you love to cook (especially seafood) it's worth a visit.
Good selection of seafood (hence the name right?). They have a lot of items not offered in other Asian markets. This place primarily caters to the Filipino community. Nice and clean with a great variety of fast food places.
Great seafood selection at reasonable prices; fresh looking squid, salmon, shrimp, whole tropical fish, octopus, baby octopus, and a large selection of frozen fish and shell-fish. On top of that, they have a large and usually quite busy meat counter, packaged meat section [including marinated pork belly], fresh seaweed salad [a personal favorite- I can eat tons of it at a time], lots of frozen dumplings, gyoza, lumpia, imported fruit, etc. Lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, too, which might be hard to find anywhere else including taro, banana blossoms, and a wide variety of chiles. Lots of dried/salted/seasoned fish & fishballs/sausages, chicken and quail eggs, masago, tofu, and tons of sauces, teas, chips, candies, and kitchen equipment. Parking can be ridiculous sometimes, and having been the only white girl in the area I've gotten some intense stares- but nothing too uncomfortable or weird. I don't know enough about philipino cooking to utilize everything in the store, but I've found things I recognize and enjoy but might not find frequently - daifuku for one. Cheap sake and tasty beer [Red Horse] don't hurt, either. Interesting and useful resource to have in the Vegas valley!
everytime i come here, it feels like home. it has everything i need. grocery, dvd, jolibee and chow king.. :)
This place is dangerous, whether you want to cook the food yourself or buy it already cooked. The Filipino buns are dangerous and so is the fresh fish. DELICIOUS! If you don't feel like cooking that day, no problem, buy the "freshly fried chicken (make sure it's been fried recently or you won't enjoy the experience like I did)," then you pick up a halo halo next door at Red Ribbon Bakery and you are set for your "low fat meal." Just kidding! It will kill your arteries, but you will enjoy it! I had to boycott this place because I was gaining weight too rapidly in one month! Now, I have stayed away for three months and I am missing that wonderful taste of the beans and condensed milk, from the halo halo ;(
I love this place. So far, I am not disappointed with this place. I have been a few times and gotten what I wanted. I have bought kimchi, coco jam, and other things. I like it so much that I took Grandma with me one day and she loved it. We like it because we can get fresh seafood, different meat, veggies, fruits, just about anything. They even have restaurants such as Jollibee. The restaurant has excellent food. This is a definite place to do your grocery shopping and great food to eat.
REVIEW FROM A NON-ASIAN:

I don't go there for the food at all.  Although I have eaten at some of their entryway diners and the food was acceptable.  

I go there for their beauty product selections.  It's not an extremely large selection, but they have products I can't find anywhere else, and prices to die for.

I usually stock up when I go since I don't live close and I make a trip specifically for these items when I go there. 

I love to buy their allue collection make-up for my daughters, it's cheap and decent quality and I don't get mad if my kids lose it or waste it.

MOSTLY, I like to buy their line of daily scents, and baby cologne.  These are great for after your shower and I like to rub them on my arms before going out, the smell is great and lasts a long time.  I feel comfortable hugging & shaking hands with people knowing that I am extending a lovely fresh scent when doing so.

They also have some nice facial bars & soaps.

Very bright, brilliant eye shadow colors are easy to find here.  Same with nail polish, although I haven't bought any nail polish here.

They also have good prices on scented baby lotions as well.  I buy those too.

They do accept credit cards, but F.Y.I., they do not allow you to get cash back.  I don't really care, but I thought you should know up front.
Gyoza crazy me, I don't always have the time nor the inclination to go out to eat, so one of the first things I do wherever I live is seek out an Asian supermarket.  

Kampai!!!  Seafood City on Maryland Parkway is the jackpot.  Bags of gzyoza to pick from so that at any given moment I have a selection in my freezer.  

The product lines concentrate on Filipino foods, but there's enough variety to satisfy most.  Big and airy, high ceilings, well lit and huge, the produce is always fresh and a much better deal than other supermarkets in the area.  Also included are fruits and vegetables beyond the usual broccoli spears and eggplant.

There's also a variety of fast food establishments as you enter their doors, which make good soups and the standard fried chicken baskets.

Just finished off a bag of gyoza...  may have to do a DUMPLING RUN soon...
Love this store.... better than Ranch 99. It use to be that I went to Ranch 99 because it was the only place to get all you asian cuisine items (versus little mom/ pop filipino shops that might not having everything you are looking for). I believe that Seafood City here in Las Vegas is much cleaner than the ones I have seen in CA (granted they are like a VONS in CA). We only have one here in Vegas.

So as far as other Seafood City markets go, this is a nice clean one. I don't think it smells as bad as Ranch 99 either.
i vacationed in the Philippines a lot when I was younger, and have spent a lot of my life in Asian/Filipino markets in California..  seafood city is all that I remember about those specific markets and more.

it's totally hooked up with all your filipino/asian needs and kept bright and clean.  I come here mostly because it's hard to find fresh veggies, meats, and seafood for cheap at local american markets.  i also go here to buy rice and pick up all the indigenous ingredients for my culturally indigenous foods. ;)  

come through  if u need to send things door to door, swoop up a pinoy pride shirt,  pacqiao trinkets, santo nino's, skin whitening or papaya soap.. [lol]

you can even hang out with all the peoples chillin!  grab a bite to eat at chow king or jolly bee.. or hit up red ribbon for dessert!

haha.. this is a monthly trip for me cause it's far.. but if it were closer i'd be picking up my meat and veggies from seafood city every week.
Seafood City is a great place to grab ingredients for you typical Asian/Filipino dishes. Adding to they're variety of Asian/Filipino foods they also have a grocery like any other Neighborhood Walmart would.  Definitely a good place to do some grocery shopping. Prices are average facilities are clean and order, they also have a Jollibee, Chow King, and Red Ribbon in the same store if you get hungry.
Getting to prepare Filipino meals require Filipino ingredients. To eat Filipino food, get Filipino supplies, cook it Filipino way, cater or succumb to take-out ready-made food. Not just Filipino items are available in this supermarket but Thai, Japanese, Malaysian or other Asian fare. A large supermarket with fresh vegetables, rice, canned foods, beverages, soups, fruits, eggs, frozen food, ice cream, cookware, rice cookers, hair & beauty supplies, meats, live & fresh seafood is a shopper's delight. "Balut" or the well-known Filipino delicacy of duck-with-embryo-egg is available as well as quail eggs.("Balut" is eaten best with salt and lemon juice and pairs well with a beer ("cerveza")). Recently, the addition of a Fish Fryer offers your fresh seafood fried and ready for you to take home without the cleaning and cooking tasks needed when you get home. There is a line at the Seafood section as fish is at a low affordable price and the fish frying is a great convenience. You will find this in the left side of the supermarket upon passing through the passageway next to the cash registers. The fresh produce of fruits and vegetables is on the right side of the supermarket.

Adjacent to the supermarket entry is "Chow King" also offers hot meals, soups, hot taho, ube or pandan smoothies and combination meals of chicken, meat or fish. Also, "Jollibee" is a fast food joint where Filipino style Spaghetti (which I must warn you is on the sweetness in taste), burgers, fries, mini sandwiches and munch on a Filipino style fried chicken called "Chicken Joy". A Beauty Salon called "Monet" for your haircut and beauty needs. "Red Robbin Bakeshop" offers breads, cakes, pastries and hot meals. 

Restrooms are in "Chow King" and in "Jollibee". Read about latest local and international Filipino news from a variety of newsmagazines and newspapers stocked in newspaper bins by the sliding doors to the supermarket. Parking lot is accessible and this clean supermarket stays open from 7 a.m. to 12 p.m. 

Communicating in English with Filipino attendants, servers and staff is not like being in a foreign land. Take time to browse around and ask questions from helpful supermarket associates if you are unfamiliar of Filipino or Asian supplies and viands.
I love going here! It's like my go to place for all the Filipino/Asian foods! It's heck of a lot cleaner than Ranch 99 on Spring Mtn. and I love the service of them cleaning your fish.  I'm also glad they had a number service system, which allows you to pick up your (cleaned fish) or meat and etc.  It's been a lot more organized since it first opened up.  Sometimes I am a little sad that some vegetables aren't there or the sliced salmon filets are usually gone by the middle of the day.  If you want the fresh stuff, get here early in the A.M.  People do tend to buy more in bulks, so you can kiss your fresh stuff goodbye.  Aside from that, I'm glad they're open late.  It's good for my hours, especially when I do get off late.  They're open from 8 to 12 I think? I don't know if they changed the hours.  

You can find all Philippines beauty products, a little pricey but I think this is the only big beauty central.  I love how there's a Chow King, Jolibee and Red Ribbon.  It just makes shopping easier!  If you're looking for Filipino vegetables and what not, stop by here.  There stuff is most of the time fresh!  And they 75% of the time have what you're looking for!
I just got off the phone with them to find out how much it costs for lobster per lb.  They absolutely refused to tell me.  I told them I live all the way on the West side, and with the cost of gas at $3 per gallon, can't they tell me the price?  They said no...it's their policy not to give prices over the phone.  When I called all these other supermarkets they obliged.
I've to say I expected better from this big corporation but it failed my expectations.  First of all I bought a parrot fish roughly 3 lbs and had them clean it. The wait was hefty but I will excuse that because I understand they were busy. But the thing is I took that fish home and baked it in the oven well over the recommend time and my family got sick!! I'm no ametuer about cleaning nor cooking fish, I was raised on a island most of my life. Anyways, I also noticed the seafood area didn't look like it had alot of care taken into it. Most of the fish was smelly, like old smelly. Even I know when it starts smelling and the eyes get glassy you should remove it from the selling area. The last thing that somewhat irritated me was the cashier was talking in tagalog the whole time to the other cashier in the next lane. She didn't even greet me, tell me my total or even say thank you. I've been to most of the asian markets and even the cashiers that don't speak English try show me some manners and smile. I don't believe I will be going here EVER again!
This is one of the most extensive seafood markets that I would've never expected to find in the heart of a city. 

The selection here is excellent. You walk in, and there are rows of fish on ice, live crabs, crawfish, and lobsters. Pick out what  you want, take it to the counter, so they'll clean it for you, and wait for your number to be called. It's as simple as that and quicker than you would imagine.

I'd definitely go here again. Etiquette tip: do not play with the fish and make them talk to people. It kind of freaks out some of the Asians that are there shopping, but if that's your thing, it's up to you.
Seafood City Rocks!!!  I wish we have one here in New York.  They have eveything that a supermarket has and more.....mostly are products from the Philippines....from Canned Goods,  Biscuits, Spices to Beauty Products...Shampoos, Cologne and Magazines....but they also have Thai, Malaysian, Chinese & Japanese products as well!!

The seafood section are neatly arranged and clean...Great selection foryour pleasure!!! .You can also have the luxury of having your fish fried, ... you don't have to do it when you go home...something we don't have here in New York...I know they also have the same service in California and Seattle!!!...!!!! 

I find the prices very reasonable and affordable...Great place...hope they open one here in New York soon and give Hongkong Supermarket a run for their money!!!!...
Great produce selection, both common (apples, oranges, tomatoes,etc.) to the more uncommon and exotic(jackfruit, durian, lychee, dragonfruit)

Like you can find everything for a house at Home Depot, you can find everything you need here to throw a Filipino Fiesta!

I usually just shop here for Filipino dessert ingredients and hardly anything perishable because when we make a stop here, we're out and about and not on the way home....ALOHA!!!
It's a love-hate relationship, i must say.

Love: if you love filipino goodies, this is the best place! They even sell stuff you can't even find somewhere else. It's where I pick up stuff that reminds me of HOME. 
They have a large variety of seafood and meat here. their stuff tends to run out later on the day so its best to go shop earlier in the day.
Fresh fish. Fresh seafoods. Even live crabs and lobsters. Playing with the live crabs makes me happy.
There are fast food restaurants around the supermarket complex. Chowking, Red Ribbon and Jollibee.
They sell fresh bread right nextdoor, Valerio's bakery.
Open from 7am till midnight.
Clean and organized.

Hate: Parking.  They do have really huge parking space, but since it's one of the biggest Filipino supermarket in town, people do come here a lot!! So go off hours.
The distance on every registers are REALLY narrow. Even the shopping carts couldn't fit.
The meat counter can be overwhelming, esp the line for fish cleaning.
They can be a little too overpriced. You can find some of their exact stuff at Walmart or 99 Cents Store for about 2-3x cheaper.

I love you more than I hate you, so I'll keep visiting.
longanisa!!!!1 (totally spelled it wrong)
This is the place to get it. THE PLACE!
I've got mixed feelings about Seafood City.

What I like: They've got Magnolia Coconut Ice Cream Bars. Sure other Asian stores have them, but their are always in stock and reasonably priced. They usually have a goodly amount of steamed cheesecake onhand. I love this little Japanese dessert because it is nice and light and not too sweet. I don't have to make a separate purchase at Red Ribbon cause they have the mamon sponge cake in store as well. And lastly my mom usually finds all her beloved Filipino ingredients.

What I dislike: It's crowded. Ugh. The store is always packed. I don't think I have ever been there at a time when it wasn't filled with people. If I wanted to willingly subject myself to agoraphobia I'd just go to Walmart on a Saturday at 10 a.m.  And the parking lot is crowded as well. Sometimes I feel sorry for those people who just want to go to Jason's Deli. And of course the smell. Sometimes I can ignore it or it's not too bad, but other times the fish smell is overwhelming.

All in all, this is a great place if you are shopping for Filipino foodstuffs. I usually only get over to it if I am on a shopping trip with my mom. I think one of the biggest draws for me is visiting Chow King for a mango shake - but that is an entirely different review.
This is very out of the way for me, but since we were in the area, we decided to stop in. 

I wanted fish, but it was such a long line for cleaning and such that it probably will be an hour before we get our stuff ready to go home. 

Filipino products are obviously abundant and there are some harder to find offerings here. I think if there's some odd thing I need to recreate a Filipino dish this is my go-to. Most dishes though use very common ingredients that I can find in the Asian marts much closer to my area so I don't see myself coming out of the way to come here. 

It's a good place for Asian needs on this side of town, but it's nothing special if you're a Filipino living somewhere like the NW like me.
I was running low on foodstuffs so thought I would check this place out after my classes. The front area of the place is a food court, with a couple of different dining and bakery establishments. The place actually reminds of Fubonn Shopping Center in Portland, OR, except it is Filipino than Chinese/Vietnamese.

I wasn't terribly impressed with the fresh vegetable and fruit selections. I mean, the prices seemed decent and all but I was expecting more variety. Same with the meat selection. There was a cut of beef that I had been wanting to buy, but they did not have it. I did like the fact that they had all sorts of offal. The fish and seafood selection is probably what they are best known for. I saw many people in the self-service are picking up mollusks and shrimps. There was also a long line for fish cleaning.

Since it is so close to the university, this is a good place for me to stop by after school to pick up common Asian-y foodstuffs.
Filipino grocery store open 24 hours.

They have eveything that a supermarket has and more. Most are products from the Philippines but from other Asian countries as well. Aisles are neatly arranged and the store doesn't have that fishy decaying meat smell one encounters at these kind of stores. 

Please come to Alexandria along with the Golden Ribbon bakery and Jolie B to put to shame the competition of stores like H-Mart, Grand Mart, etc.
5 things that go through my head when I visit.

1. Presh pried pish prom Philipino polks. 

2. Ahhhhhh I feel like I'm in Daly City again. Win.

3. M u s t..  r e f r a i  n.. from.. picking up multiple packages of dried squid, mango..

4. Dude, where else am I gonna find fresh coconut and lychee on this side of town? 

5. Hmm.. What am I gonna buy from Valerios when I'm done with this place?
What other place in Vegas makes me feel like I'm back home like Seafood City does? No other place than this... Place where Tita Baby and Tito Boy shop for their filipino goods. 

It may not be the cleanest and most complete supermarket Vegas has but for it being a Filipino Supermarket it sure does the job.  Whitening soap? Check.  Red ribbon ensaymada? Check. Phone cards? Check. Filipino movies? Check. Fresh seafood staring at you in all its fishy smelling glory? Check. You can even have your fish cooked. Yes, we Filipinos are lazy and that's exactly how it is back home.

My ultimate favorite is their marinated meat and OMG their crab!!! It is soooo good. Crab fat and all. *drools*

If you don't look Filipino, don't be surprised at people staring at you.  And even if it's all the way on the other side of town what the heck, for that piece of home? Why not!
One of my faves groceries store. Make sure you go to the back of the store to get the $.99 cents coconut milk. The front ones costs more. Just a tip.
Seafood, yes.
Just avoid going to get Seafood on Sundays. It seems to the busiest times. Too long of line to drop your items off to weighed and even longer wait if you want them cleaned.

Vegetables, only if I have to. 
The quality of the veggies isn't always so fresh to me. It often looks old and withered. But i can get ube (purple yam) here so that always makes me look past this.

Filipino staple items, yes. 

Love the food courts in the front and the bakeries. Easy location with lots of offerings. I can't complain.
This market sucks...
Maybe I'm biased, since I usually shops at 168 market on Spring Mountain and Jones.
Where they have everything you need from Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, to Filipino and American. Plus their fresh fish and meat department.

I was on the UNLV side and wanted to get some fresh Asian vegetables so I decided to go to Seafood City instead driving over to Chinatown. I've been hearing so much about this Seafood City place.  

Their vegetable selection was weak, and most of them are old and dry. 
I wanted to get some Thai curry too while I was here but nope, walked down every isle and couldn't find any Thai section. I guess this market only has Filipino food?
Their fish did not seem fresh, I was checking the eyes, under the fins and it took me a good old 10 minutes before I found one that fairly decent. And there's a line of people waiting by the seafood department? I don't get it.

Don't waste your time if you are looking for a Asian market that has good and fresh selections, just drive over to Chinatown.
My moms favorite place to go when she needs to buy groceries and send money to the philippines. But for me its chaotic. Yet i still love it. 

LIKES: the products they have. Most are from the philippines. But the prices are funny. Whenever it comes down to paying, we always hit the $100 mark.  And of course i like jollibee, chowking, and red ribbon. They should add Greenwhich ahaha

DISLIKE: PARKING, SECURITY, LOCATION, and how TINY the market is. Its gets crowded easy, there are rude people who just make their way in and out of the market, people fight over parking, not enough secuity especially when it gets full, and i can barely move my cart around without saying EXCUSE ME or squeezing through aisles. They restock during the busiest hour and i find that annoying. I see boxes everywhere which makes it even more crowded. 

Relocate with a bigger store please? Like henderson... :P
Great place for Filipino fast food and if you need some groceries while you're out of town
A Midwestern guy walks into a Filipino Supermarket and gets overwhelmed. Film at 11. Wow, this was one of the more interesting places I've stepped foot into since I moved to Vegas. Parking for this place is a zoo but once you find a space you're in for an experience. 

Once inside the door the place reminds me of a Hypermarket with restaurants, a bakery, financial services, and other shops right up front. You walk past all that and into a full fledged supermarket where the first thing you notice is the smell coming from the fish which you can't see at first but you certainly know they're present. This is not your typical American supermarket. It may look like it at first glance, but it's certainly not. So what did I find here? 

Produce: They have a good selection but the pricing for some items is a bit higher than I expected. Also the produce section had a LOT of flies. As in even as oblivious as I am to some things when I notice it's pretty bad. But they had some stuff like different varieties of bananas that I haven't seen elsewhere. 

A quick loop around the store will take you to the source of the very distinctive smell, the open air fish market. They have a nice sized selection of fish and other things and after you pick out what you want they will clean it up for you. This section of the store is CROWDED. Even a big guy like me got bumped into. And if you don't like raw fish this is not the place for you as people are flying past you with all kinds of it. I overheard grumbling about how long it was taking to process the fish but I just thought it was cool and I want to go back when I can properly transport my fish home in the desert heat. 

A walk through the center of the store led me to a lot of different ethnic items, some I've seen at the International Market but quite a few items were unique to this store. The list of unique items is too long to list here, if you're looking for something your best bet is to stop in and look for yourself. I picked up a couple of things (they even had the tamarind hard candy I have trouble finding!) and went to check out. Checkout was packed but moved fast. And the people working the registers were friendly and they actually have a Point of Sale / Credit Card machine that's programmed intelligently. I want to make a point of saying checkout was easy, as it should be elsewhere. 

In short I didn't have much time to spend in here but I'm glad I went in and it was quite the experience. I will be back.
We found this place by accident (visiting a store in same plaza) and can now say without a doubt that we love this place.  You can find some cheaply priced essentials; Asian delights and very reasonably priced seafood. Oooh the seafood that was why we went back the 2nd time. 

We grabbed a few pounds  of whole shrimp and a container of old bay and we couldn't get home fast enough to cook them up and properly season them.  It was heaven; As soon as we can find a place close to the apartment where we can break crabs open and not have to worth about the after effects of smell and the random chunks of flying crab as you break them apart we will be back.  

Oh word of advice is to be sure to weigh your seafood before going to the register; it not you hold up the line and look like a fool; we thought it was kinda funny but won't be making that mistake again.  The man at the counter was very nice and was able to use his scale to weigh everything but it took a few minutes. 

Be careful/buying dairy/eggs here both of my trips here they had them sitting in the aisles.  I touched a few and they were dry and room temperature. I'm sure the health inspector would have freaked but as long as you are careful on what you buy here you won't leave disappointed.
I try to avoid this market unless its absolutely necessary. Not because the selection isn't great or because the staff isn't friendly. Its because its almost always overly busy!
Seafood City is a grocery store that is located in Maryland Parkway just off Flamingo is one of many franchises that cater specifically to the Filipino community but also other Asian and ethnic cultures.  Fairly big in size with neighbors such as Jollibee, Chow King, & Valerios Bakery rented directly in the facility...it makes it a convenient one stop shop for your Filipino needs.  You can pretty much find it all in here.  Highly advertised on the Filipino Channel, especially in California...Seafood City is like the Filipino version of Vons or Safeway...well known but can be a little highly priced on some items.

Plenty of fresh fish and vegetables to choose from.  Staff for the most part are friendly and can help you locate what you are looking for.  Shelves are continuously being stocked which is nice to see.  

The downside is that, this place gets crowded, especially on weekends and Holidays!  Parking is a pain in the @$$, but upon availability it is alright.  The parking lot is big, it is just that this place gets so packed it can get ridiculous.  I suggest getting there early or off hours to ease the tension.  

Over all it is nice place to go to, but if you are not a people person or hate crowds...you might want to head over to China Town or other asian/oriental markets around the valley instead.
Great Asian Store in bad location. Too many homeless' in the parking lot  and by front of store begging for money or cigarettes.
Very convenient for Filipino shoppers. Welcome to all. Prices are pretty decent. Some better improvement over time. Friendly employees.
This will not be one of my "adventures in womanizing". I just came here for a couple of quick items and ended up getting numbers from 3 girls. I didn't even ask. I've never really been attracted to Filipino chicks in the past... but these chicks were like those girls you see on the Filipino soap operas. I thought they were really hot.

I recently had a conversation with 3 non-Asian college students about: "Which Asian person had the most impact on Asian people today". They listed off people like: Sun Tzu, Dalai Lama, Mao Zedong, Dr. Feng Shan Ho, Norman Mineta. I being the only person of Asian descent had the most credibility in my opinion. And when it was my turn, I said that the greatest Asian person in history is MANNY PACQUAIO! My argument was that Manny Pacquaio can use his straight left hand to kick the sh!t out of the Dalai Lama, and he can sing better than him as well, therefore he is the greatest Asian person ever.

So, I came to SEAFOOD CITY for some unlicensed Pacquaio merchandise for my Filipino friend who is going to his next fight. Unfortunately, I got off work too late and the Pacquaio store was closed. I decided to just walk around a bit, and I found the selection to be much more superior to Greenland. 

We don't really got a good selection of Asian supermarkets here in LV. Every time I ask a Japanese person the question: "What's the best Japanese Market?". In a very enthusiastic voice, they always answer by screaming "GREENNNLLAANND!" I really can't tell if they are being serious or not.  Also, Notice how I am giving this place a 5-star review while I gave Greenland a 2-star.  SEAFOOD CITY has better customer service than Greenland and many of the items are like a quarter of the price. Not to mention I even got felt up by one chick while I was waiting in line to pay. This place is f*cking awesome.
Very nice place this is a place you could buy any seafood you're thinking about. I buy the Lupia wraps there so I can make my own
This place is freakin' BUSY. Amando S. made homemade Ahi Poke on St. Patrick's Day so since then I was CRAVING it!! I took a journey to Seafood City to pick up some Ahi Poke. Good prices for some slabs of Tuna! This was really all I came here for so I had my tuna and was waiting in line... lalalala - then a sales associate said since I had so few items, I could go through the customer service line. Yes! Short line. Plus they make money orders there for fifty cents and I actually needed one. SCORE.
Sells everything asian particularly filipino made products. Its like heaven when you walk in here shopping going thru each and every aisle looking for what to buy.
The fresh seafood area has a huge selection and they have an add on service where they can cook your fish.
Asians unite! Pinoy power! If you love anything asian this is the place for you! Jollibee and chow king are located within seafood city. Tons of asian influenced foods and gadgets a like.
I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review for Seafood City. Since its inception in May 2007, this has been the home to the Filipino community for all their grocery needs.  As another Yelper mentioned, this is a beehive of Filipinos, which is absolutely true.  Although occasionally I do see 1 or 2 individuals of a different ethnicity, but I'm sure they shop here for the reasonable prices. They offer everything you need to cook a home-made Filipino meal; I usually come here to grab ingredients for my parents. This place is super busy on the weekends, so I don't dare stepping foot here.  That goes along with parking, which is probably even worse.  I tend to park closer to what was previously Barnes & Noble.  There's another review on here stating she was so surprised to see kids playing with live crabs. I was guilty of that too when I was a kid, but honestly what do you expect this is a Filipino super market (Seafood City is probably the best one in town). And she ends her review with "I'll go to Whole Foods next time I need crab." That cracked me up because obviously this place is nothing like Whole Foods , but neither are the prices.
I think my rating for this place definitely has something to do with my heritage.  Let's be honest, it has everything to do with it.  I'm proud to be Filipino and this store really caters to those cultural needs!

The store is huge!  You have electronic booths (cellular services), food court-type options (Jollibee's, a Chinese restaurant and a Filipino bakery) and of course, groceries.  I love how cheap everything is in the produce department. Some of my favorites like bitter melon and other squashes seem to be substantially cheaper than other grocery stores like Smith's or Albertson's.  What I love is the fact that this store also has everything I grew up with.  It's like going through the Asian food aisle at the store...except it's the whole store!  Then, you get to the meat and fish section.  That's where the heart of the store is.  So many types of fish!  So many types of meat.  All kinds of meat parts: pork, chicken and beef.  The back counters are super efficient.  What I love is the fact that you can grab fish, like catfish, take a number and ask the back counter employees to deep fry the fish.  It's a service not many people know about.  I love it!!

If you're in the mood to make pork gisantes, adobo or other Filipino delights, come and check out this place.  I KNOW you'll find what you're looking for :)
WOW!  I called these people to ask a simple pricing question and the woman on the other end said they didn't carry my item anymore and hung up promptly!  No suggestions where I could find it, or how much it should cost at a good place....just a dial tone.  didn't think lobster was such a sensitive subject and when I tried to call back to talk to a manager, since she hung up before I could get another question out, without a goodbye, the phone was picked up and hung up AGAIN!!  So far they are shooting for really bad reviews with me.  If you are answering the phone as an employee don't be rude!  What a moron, customer service is not rocket science!  I called back a third time for the manager and what do you know; not available; I guess I'll just have to pay them a personal visit and trust me guys you won't like what I have to say.
Seafood City Supermarket is a nice grocery store that offers a lot of Filipino foods and goods in addition to American groceries. The aisles are fun to browse through, since I can't find a lot of Filipino products back at home. Prices seem pretty reasonable.
Its like a mini filipino town. Love it. Love jollibee also.
Up until recently, I'd avoided Seafood City because I don't eat seafood. I'd go to the Barnes and Noble next door (RIP) or eat at Jason's Deli, but I'd skip the City.

I decided to see what veggies and other delicacies they had. I was pleasantly surprised by the range of produce, and I was ecstatic at the dozen or more varieties of tofu offered. They also had tiny citrus trees for sale, which is awesome.

I ended up with veggies, seaweed and tofu, all at excellent prices. I'll definitely be going back for more.
Came here to buy beer for the Filipino Potluck!  

I figured since it was Filipino town here, they would have decent prices on the beers...damn, $18 for 12 packs!  Red Horse, San Miguel Lager/Negras/Lites...all $18.  Same prices as Total Wine BTW ($9 for 6 packs).

The lines really sucked...I only had a 12 pack of beer, but it took me at least 10-12 minutes standing in line.  Sounds like I am being impatient...probably am lol.

Couldn't believe how busy this place was...reminded me of a cafeteria from high school lol.  But it was pretty clean though considering the walk in traffic.
got a large selection of filipino foods. Also has decent restaurants in front of the grocery market to choose from such as jollibee, bakeries, and more. decent price. sometimes expensive.
Excellent fried fish! I love the option of picking your own fresh fish (large variety too!) and having it cleaned and fried to your liking on the spot! 
The prices are great as well.
Fun grocery store with interesting foods. I can always find something I've never tried before here.
What can i say, Its Seafood City. The staple of filipino americans trying to get some authentic back home flavor.. I mean this place even has a built in Jollibee and Chow King! Being married to a Filipina for nearly 10 years and having visited the Philippines many times i can see why this place is so popular. Get there when they open if your trying to buy fish because it gets picked over very fast. Also get ready to wait in line at the cashier, they usually only have 2 or 3 cashiers and hundreds of customers. Its not exactly the SM Grocery store..
Excellent selection of seafood and very authentic Filipino and other Asia. Items. I live in Henderson and was searching for an Octopus to Cooke because I am a chef and someone outside of work wanted to make then an Octopus Tomato sauce. I wasn't sure where to go but after calling this location the person who answered the phone was very friendly and willing to help me. She let me know there was 1 octopus left and said she would hold it for me. As I was in there, the selections of shell fish and other fish was awesome. Being from Florida it is hard to find good seafood out here in Vegas so I was very impressed with some of their options. Whenever I am need of some fresh seafood or whole fish I will definitely be going back to this store. And a bonus they have a Jollibee in their supermarket. I have seen this fast food restaurant on many different shows and always wanted to try it, this place is a must go!
This place is crazy!  it was like black Friday!  OMG, people everywhere!  People, don't move out of your way!  I this was my first visit, but "I AIN'T GOT TIME FOR THAT" I'm going to have to figure out a time to go there where it's not all crazy!  But it was cool, I wasn't expecting a food court in there!  it's not only just seafood, its a full grocery store as well.  But they had fish on ice there.  You pick what you want.  My only thing is, I don't know for sure, but I think you have to gut it too ( ewwwwww)  I can't do it or look at it being done.   But when I want something good, I know where to go and pick it up.  I'm glad I have a husband that can do the dirty work for me.
Let me start this review by saying that you don't have to be Asian to shop here! A few of my coworkers asked me if I can get some things for them. I asked them why couldn't they get it themselves? They replied with "We are not Asian and they might treat us differently". I should of been offended right? Nope. Instead I said, "They will only treat you different if you act like jerks so don't be one and you'll be ok."

Seafood City is similar to 99 Ranch but caters more to the Filipino population. If you have ever eaten at a Filipino restaurant, this is where you will find most if not all the ingredients in all the dishes you eat. 

I come here for all sorts of things like different flavored chips, nuts, biscuits, crackers, etc. Drinks like coconut juice. mango juice, calamansi juice, etc. 

Basically, a lot of items you just cant find at your basic Smith's or Albertsons. What is also great is the location of this place. If you get hungry there is a Chow King and a Jollibee just right in front where you enter.

The layout of their place is nice also. All the way to the right you have all your vegetables. All the way to the back you have all your refrigerated items. All the way to the left are all the seafood/meat items along with the frozen section. In between you have all the aisles with all the little things I mentioned in my 3rd paragraph.

Service is actually above average. They usually have enough people on registers so that long lines are virtually non existent. Most of the time each cashier has their own assistant that bags all the merchandise you just bought. 

So for those non Asians, just relax and shop just like you would at any other supermarket. Sometimes its ok to shop somewhere different. You never know, you just might find something you really like here.
This grocery store is good for those of you needing filipino food supplies. The 50LBS of Jasmin Rice is cheap and the food selections are wonderful. I do however recommend if you dont speak Tagalog then bring someone with you that does.
Ah, the one stop shop for all things Filipino. Yes, it's true, a lot of Asian people lounge here to buy their groceries, or pick up their favorite snacks. 

My parents usually drop by to pick up some tocino (Filipino breakfast meat) that you can just pop in the pan and cook away. 

It's cleaner than Chinatown here and the staff is super helpful. Prices are comparable, a lot of the time it'll be a little more pricer than Chinatown..

Also, you gotta know when to go so that it's not busy = late at night, 2-3 hours before it closes. Filipinos usually be gettin their jollibee and chowking flow on, and you can be free to shop in Seafood City!
This is a Filipino market that also has other Asian stuff. You have to come here on a weekday at an odd time to avoid the crowd of little old Filipino ladies that cut in front of you...I'm pretty tall for an Asian so I'm sure they can see me but old Filipino ladies don't care. Parking can be chaotic. Filipinos are not used to traffic signs/rules so it can get frustrating. Being half-Filipino, I am aware of the lack of discipline which is a trait common among Filipinos...I can't stand it!

Valerio's is a bakery to the left of the entrance of Seafood City. They have good sugar doughnuts that are super heavy and filling...and other Filipino breads and baked goods. They only take cash.

When you walk in, to the left is Chowking. To the right you got Jollibee and Red Ribbon. Straight ahead is a bunch of stalls selling phone cards and a travel agency. Behind all that is a grocery store.

Today, I was looking for ingredients for kare-kare for a potluck - that was my main mission. I couldn't find peanut butter so I asked one of the employees stocking the shelves. "Excuse me! Excuse me! Where can I find peanut butter?" But he ignored me or he's completely deaf. Denied! I should've talked in thick PILIPINO aksent and said "hoy kuya where is da feanat vatter?" And who would've used his lips to point to where I need to go. 

So I ended up leaving with cracker nuts and cakes from Red Ribbon. Mission failed! Since the potluck isn't til next week, I'd have to come back here to buy oxtails and veggies. Sweet Jesus, give me the patience!
I'll admit it, I love coming here!!! I get all the essential Filipino things and also get entertained by all my uncles and aunties in the thick flip accent. 

Every month or two, I'll take the twenty minute drive to the not so nice part of town and load up on all the Filipino necessities. (Quick tip, don't come here when you are drunk because you will end up spending way more than you originally planned.) On my last adventure, we had to get rice, longanisa (Filipino sweet sausage), soup mixes and chicken. Aside from necessities, we found Red Horse (beer), pastries and lychee. 

Be prepared for long check out times depending what time of the day you are here. The employees here aren't that helpful. If you ask where a certain something is, they'll just point with their lips and assume you can find it yourself. They can clean and fry your fish while you finish your shopping. If you work up an appetite after you shop, there is a Jollibee and Chow King conveniently located inside. 

P.S. "Eight pipty por, your order is ray-dee"
I love this store!  Almost all the products remind me of Philippines.  Every time I'd come here I would stop by jolly-bee and then shop for cheap snacks and drinks!  If your Filipino, love seafood, or like cheap things you should go here.  They sell so many things.  If I could, I would go here every day. :)
They offer fresh seafood and all kinds of Filipino/Asian items n ingredients. even seasonal fruits from the Philippines like lansones, rambutan n many more. 4 stars coz it's somewhat pricey. 


Their is definitely something for everybody.
It is one of the cleanest seafood city supermarkets i have seen.  I haven't seen seafood city supermarket so lively in awhile. I like the set-up of the place. Jollibee, Red Ribbon and Chowking is very inviting and the open area is welcoming to the public. I also like the background of the parking lot, you can see the silhouette from the strip standing from there.
This is part of a chain of markets.  They seem to specialize in Filipino foods in particular, but there is a variety of other stuff.  Plus mostly fresh seafood (I mean, this is Vegas...there is no ocean...but it still seems pretty fresh).

Plus lots of grocery items for the Asian/Filipino recipes you want to do.  Patis, bagoong, sauce for Filipino spaghetti, etc, etc.  Overall, a good market.
This place is packed, the Deli counter is the worst,seems like everyone is here for fresh fish and meats.Have at least 20minutes or more to pick up something!
I am a huge fan of Seafood city.  I love going to explore and find something new to try.  It is also great for all of those things you can't find in your regular store, like manostein. 

Yea it is busy, especially on the weekends, but that is part of the fun of it.  Everyone is very friendly and the staff there is very helpful.  If you are looking to try something new or are looking for some specialty stuff, this is the place for you.
I love ethnic grocery stores, it's like you can take a trip to a foreign country without leaving your hometown! Seafood City is a fun place to do just that. I've never bought much here except for some exotic spices and snacks, but the seafood department is something of a marvel. I find myself staring at all the fresh fish for almost an hour ever time I'm in here. Although the parking lot is huge, parking can be a zoo, especially during the weekends. Worth a stop if only for the educational aspect of the place. For foodies, it's a no-brainer!
Sigh.. First the lady thought I was paying together when there was a divider separating their items from mine. She just took it out and included my items with theirs. Theirs a divider for a reason... Even though we're in a group together doesn't mean we're paying all together.. And plus she charged me for the full price of the items I got! She didn't put it for the sales discount... -.-
You guys, I have this really humongous love-hate relationship with Seafood City.. & here's why:

LOVE: I love that I can drive to a little "home away from home" market that definitely has the feel of being back in the Philippines. You have Chow King and Jollibee PLUS Red Ribbon inside. And the actual market has vegetables/fruits for your Filipino dish. They also sell balut here! But be warned, BALUT is not for the faint of heart! Middle section has condiments, the tabo that you've been needing for your bathroom to wash your pwet, Milo & other Filipino and non-Filipino beverages, and as well as your Filipino chichiria (snacks). Then you have the meats and seafood in the left side of the market which is actually my favorite because it really reminds me of the palengkes in the Philippines. You choose your own fish and put in the bag basically. Prices here are fairly reasonable. It's also pretty clean compared to the other Asian markets in Vegas. And the staff are super nice!

HATE: Oh goodness, what I don't like about this place is how crowded it is in the market. It's small and two people can barely fit in the aisles. I also don't like how my little home away from home is nearly a 30 minute drive from my house. I seriously wish that they would build a Seafood City closer to where I live, and it wouldn't hurt if it was a tad bit bigger than it is now.

Overall: Despite my little rant there, I would have no other choice but to come back here when needed. It's the only Seafood City in Vegas. It's the only place that would remind me of "home".
My only rant about this place is there should be a designated smoking area/break area for their employees. I dislike walking into the store smelling smoke. Everytime I go in the store, their employees are just standing on the side smoking cigarettes. Uggghhh!!!
I had to bring my mother and the titas (aunties) here while they were visiting so they could have their Filipino food in the time share where they were staying.  I've been here before, but only very quickly to get halo-halo ingredients. On this recent visit, I had a chance to browse the aisles since the ladies like to linger-shop.  I don't eat fish, but if you buy fish here, they will clean it for you in the butcher section.  The beauty section sells whitening soap for the "dark complected"--hmm, interesting, but I don't think I'll ever use that.  I had no idea that they sold frozen Filipino dishes a la Lean Cuisine:  pop it in the microwave for a few minutes and bam- sisig is ready!  There was a lot of yelling going on over the intercom: "Sharlene, please return to your register!"  Sharlene was called more than once since she must not have heard the yelling the first time, even though the rest of us did.  There was also more than one crying baby.  In fact, the whole visit was very noisy and it felt just like the name suggests:  being on the street in the city.  However, this is one place where we Pinoys can get our native food and you should come to here if you ever need or want some.  Hopefully Sharlene is at her register (name has been changed to protect the innocent who was probably at Jollibee on break having spaghetti with hot dogs).
I love how they have everything you need that's from the Philippines and other asian countries.  They also have 2 restaurants for you to eat.  One is Jollibee and the other is Chow King.  The both are good.  The only reason why I gave 3 stars is because it's really crowded.   I wish they would make this place a little bigger like the Boulevard Mall.   The best time to come here is in the mornings not as crowded.
I totally love this store!! I'm a big fan of seafood and Asian foods. They have a wide variety of everything you would need to make Asian food. I love to make Pancit and lumpia and they always have the ingredients that I need.  

Not only is it a great store, they are located just down the street from me which is a big plus for me. I like to be able to just run down the street and get the items I need without going all over town for it. 

Downside for me is that this place is so popular that it's ALWAYS so crowded and busy. I always feel rushed to get my items and get out.
Seafood City is a pretty good place to shop. There is an assortment of Filipino/Asian products without having to go to Chinatown. It lives up to its namesake and you'll find whole Yellowfin Tuna down to wild caught Oregon sardines. They also carry Filipino beers, Kewpie mayo, Filipino toiletries and magazines. It's a one-stop to the Philippines. Inside the shopping center, they have Pinoy franchises such as Jollibee, Chow King and Valerios Bakery. There is also an esthetician behind the Asian jewelry counter.

The location is centric; it's close to the Strip, airport and major streets. Inside, it is clean and the employees follow sanitation guidelines based on what I see. I have family in the culinary industry and pay attention to these things. The staff is okay; they are not overly friendly, but are not rude to us. Perhaps looking Pinoy helps, based on some reviews, which is unfortunate since this is business. 

What kept me from giving the one-stop shop 5 stars are two things, one worse than the other. The groceries are fresh for the most part, but sometimes are not at peak freshness depending on the day one shows up. Fortunately, I do not have to trek too far or else I'd be upset. 

Onto the bad thing about Seafood City. There are a few customers who cause trouble. A few weeks ago, we witnessed Africans fist fighting outside of the Jollibee section. They were hollering (maybe profanities) in their language. Although the police arrived, human detritus has come to shore at Seafood City. There are some vagrants who hang outside the store and parking lot who beg for money. 

A few days ago, my mom encountered a rude male customer who was pushing her out of the way with his shopping cart and pushing his groceries ahead of hers while flailing his arms at her, thus creating physical contact. When she told him to stop and say "excuse me", he claimed that he couldn't tell whether she spoke English or not. Regardless of a customer's level of English literacy, everyone understands "excuse me." Even recent Spanish speaking immigrants know and say "excuse me" with thick accents. My mother was about to move on, but saw the same man chatting and laughing with the nonchalant security guard about what he did to her. Mom told the security what the man did and that he should do his job and then pretended to scold the man.

I think I will have to consider going to Chinatown, even if the trip is further away.
Best place in Vegas for fresh oysters for about $1 each! I come here quiet often, at least once a week and its a rarity in Vegas to find a place that doesn't try to do too much. This mom and pops joint sticks to what their good at, Mexican Seafood.

The restaurant is also very spacious and clean which is a plus for it being in a bad location away from the strip and practically surrounded by nothing else.

This place isn't just cheap, it offers some of the best seafood in town when it comes to oysters, ceviche, and shrimp cocktails.
Wonderful mexican seafood. I come here every weekend and every time the food is really fresh. I love this place.
Wonderful place for AUTHENTIC, read AUTHENTIC Mexican seafood.  They have shrimp cocktail, but the shrimp swim in a combination of clam juice, lime juice, and other ingredients.  They are simply the best.  These are NOT your American 99 cent shrimp cocktails.  These are amazing.  Also recommended is the Shrimp with Butter    aka Shrimp ala Mantequilla.  It comes with rice and salad.  Tortillas, bread, and french fries are also served.  The french fries in this place are not promoted very heavily (they are on the kids menu) but they are GREAT!  I've tried a lot of stuff here and keep going back, week after week.
Decent seafood for a hole in the wall. I would not go back there again though.
This place is the business.
When I visit Vegas I always make sure I come here for some good seafood.
Definitely recommend to try out!
Growing up in Southern CA I have done my fair share of road trips down the coast of Baja California. The seafood here is the closest thing I have come by that takes me back to being barefoot on the beach enjoying authentic seafood.
The setting can create some hesitancy at first but once you relax and more importantly become enamoured by the deliciousness in front of you, it soon melt away. Maybe it was growing up and traveling down south, but I find some sort of comfort in the plastic utensils, and casual simplicity at times. 
I knew I had made a good choice when all the people eating there were all obvious regulars/family and the steady flow of customers all knew each other. You don't get an ambiance like that from producing sub-par dishes.
I cant wait to go back with some family members when they visit.
Great little hole in the wall.  I just moved here from southern california so I had yet to find a good mariscos locations.  But this spot is definitely the best Ive tried in vegas. I had the shrimp coctele, ceviche tostada, and shared some oysters.  All the food was on point, the only thing I didnt like was that their micheladas were basically just beer and clamato mix; nothing special. Other than that a great eat!
Pretty good place. Tasted fresh. I wish the shrimp ceviche was a bit more limey, and spicier. They are also kinda stingy on the toastadas lol, I had to end up using crackers to eat my shrimp . Fish tacos were really good as well. Overall, I will come back again.
Bad tasting food and service. I was surprised they don't serve chips and salsa to munch on while your food is prepared. If you want to hear music you have to pay for it at the iTunes box. Will never come back or recommend this place.
Great oysters. Fish ceviche needed more flavor, but overall, everything was great. Friendly service.
Service is amazing!!! We were greeted and our drinks came out promptly. The restaurant's atmosphere is clean and inviting. We ordered several tostadas of camaron (shrimp), pescado (fish) and mixta (shrimp, fish and octopus).  My mother had fish tacos, out of sight! There are always restaurants that try to live up to "authentic" well this is one of them.  Can't wait to come back!!! The Chef and their staff really make you feel welcomed and valued!!!
ordered some shrimp tacos.. super yummy...        jaiva tostada... not so much... Micheladas! amazing.....        Enjoyed Nice Banda....for hours.... and good atmosphere!!! definitely will come again... Service on Point...very courteous! with a large group of people
Super fresh. Very good can't go wrong. Make sure and order a prepared beer ! And the shrimp cocktail is also good. No farm raised shrimp here like some other bunk places. As soon as you walk in it smells like the ocean always a good sign of how fresh the place is.
2/5 for service.
1/5 food.
Mariscos Vallarta were suppose to be from Vallarta, not a single Vallartence working in this place. Very disappointed I suggest them to change their name and food.
I had the best fish burrito I've ever had here. Good beer selection too. Definitely looking forward to coming back and trying more items.
Mad props to Matt S. and Brook M. for leading me to this place. This place is a winner! Hands down the best Mexican food in Las Vegas to date. 

This is Mexican seafood the way it should be eaten. Fresh. Delicious. Simple. It reminds me of the little Mexican food stands in San Pedro, you know the places that  serve what was brought in the boat that morning. I can't describe it, you have to taste it to experience it. The fish tastes different, it doesn't taste like fish, just the most delicate, soft, pieces of protein I've ever eaten. How does this place gets fish that fresh? Dunno... but hey, it works! 

Besides their excellent fish tacos, I got their Tostada Mixta, a ceviche made with shrimp, octopus, and imitation crab. Again, excellent, as was their shrimp taco. 

The place is ultra divey, I mean, there's bars on the windows, that's scary divey. The place itself is clean but it caters to a mostly hispanic clientele. But that's how you know it's authentic. LOL. So, prepared to be adventurous. Also the place isn't cheap, the tostada was $6 and the tacos were $3 or $4 each. But for the quality of the seafood, definitely worth it!
I am originally from Los Angeles and was looking for a great Mexican sea food place to eat.. We ended up in this place and to my surprise the food was really delicious, however customer service was horrible. The waitress was very rude and the smell of this place is disgusting... If you plan on coming here make sure to seat by the entrance or bring nose plugs otherwise you will be smelling the smell of the restroom while eating your good!!!!!
I'm giving this place 3 stars for now. It's could be 4 stars but I may have ordered the wrong thing....

I ordered the whiting, fried. I should have ordered it Cajun fried because there was no seasoning in he batter. Also the batter is cornmeal, I don't mind this but some do. The fries were good as were the red beans and rice.

I do plan to try this place again as it is difficult to find good seafood that isn't expensive. They fry, grill, etc. they also have barbecue and fried chicken. This is also a fish market where you can buy fresh seafood and fish.

I really hope this place is worthy of a 4 star review.
Delivery of seafood? Awesome! I found this place on GrubHub, apparently an extension of the Nile Cafe next door. Anyway, great seafood for pickup or delivery. They have a table or two outside if you wish to dine here.
The brisket was basically cooked meat, a little dry no real personality, canned barbeque sauce on the side.  The fish was a little under done so I threw it out.  The two sides were nice, coleslaw was just right and the potato salad was done really well.  I did not know it was going to be a long wait for lunch or I would have called ahead.  It was a little dirty so we won't go back.
Great for those nights that you do not want the usual pizza or Chinese food delivered to your door.  Has a multitude of different types of fish that can be cooked many different styles with some awesome sides to back them up.  They quoted us 30 minutes delivery time and it only took them 15 minutes!
It was OK but no where near the best fish in town.  Really salty (drank like crazy all afternoon).  Coleslaw was typical "from the tub".  No malt vinegar--what is with that--when you have fish, you need vinegar, not ketchup.  Extremely limited seating.
I went to J&M Fish Market today with my Mom. We were greeted by a very polite young man, who explained the menu to us. I ordered Cajun Grilled Red Snapper, and chose grilled veggies and collard greens as my sides. Mom ordered fried whiting, and chose cole slaw and collard greens. We decided to eat at one of the outside tables. The food was quite tasty, and the service was excellent. The greens were so good that I wanted to bring some home for my husband. I asked our server, and even though the kitchen was already closed, he got me the greens. At no charge. A great experience, we will surely be back.
The whiting (they ran out of catfish) was all kinds of bland except for a really strong fishy flavor (whiting is the least supposed to taste like fish), especially for "cajun fried", or was that what the bucket of hot sauce was supposed to represent? The jerk chicken tacos tasted nothing of jerk, the only noticable flavor was from the sweet thai chili sauce added on the side. The mac and cheese side was a congealed mass of fake cheese with some tasteless noodles to bind it together, and the rice and red beans were essentially that, a layer of rice with canned red beans poured over top. 

The only saving grace was my partner's cajun grilled tilapia, the highlight of the meal.
We ordered the Tilapia grilled with fries and cole slaw and roll + chicken fingers with mac & cheese. 

The Tilapia size was above average and grilled perfectly. The cole slaw was also tasty. Fries needed just a little longer cooked. 

The Chicken fingers were breaded fresh and cooked perfectly. Mac & cheese was not good. 

Customer Service is very friendly and inviting. We would for sure go back. I recommend trying the Tilapia. I think they have some things to work out on the sides but overall pretty good.
This place is connected to J & M Fish Market, so decided to give it a try for dinner. Place was deserted, service was slow and they were out of the first 3 items I ordered (Clam Strips, Whiting/ Atlantic White Fish and Red Snapper).  Maybe the place is still pretty new, and they haven't figured out how much to order? Even if that's the case, I still thought it was a bit odd to be out of so many items.

I ended up ordering the BBQ Rib Tips.  The meat was really dry, with not much BBQ sauce, so I asked for some on the side.  The sauce was likely out of a bottle.  Overall, I would say the food was OK...  Not great, not bad, just OK.

I had a slice of cheesecake before leaving.  Not homemade, a little dry, but pretty good.

Not sure I would give the place another try, but we'll see...
Really wanted to like this place and i bought two groupons.  Probably deserves 3.5 stars. Listen, the service is very good.  Last night I called a take out order in, and it was ready and all wrapped up 20 mins later when i got there to pick it up; server was very friendly.  You also get a good amount of food for the price ($10-$15); you get the piece of fish, two sides (ive only had veges and red beans + rice), and a cornbread muffin.    

However, the fish is just not that good.  I got two orders last night, 1 walleye and 1 snapper, both grilled.  One of the filets look like like some massacred the fish with a dull machete.  The other filet looks appealing, but had some small bones in it.  The taste of both was also very bland, and neither really tasted fresh; rather, they were somewhat tough and dry - so i doubt the fish is actually fresh.   They should also include a lemon wedge.  No idea why they dont.  However, the sides were very good and the muffin was a nice surprise.   

So, you get a decent "fresh" fish meal and with a good amount of food for under 15 bucks, so its not that bad.  But, on the other hand, the fish is just not very good.  Maybe if you get it fried it will taste better - but then whats the point of getting fish if your just going to make it unhealthy?
This place is phenomenal! I highly recommend the cajun red snapper, seasoned veggies , and red beans and rice. The waiter was incredibly polite and created a delightful dining experience.
I wish I had better things to say.

I called in my order and they said 15 min.  40 min later I was still waiting for my food.  I ordered jerk chicken taco, ultimate nachos and rib tips with mac and cheese and potato salad.  They forgot to give me the sides - mac and cheese and potato salad.  

Jerk chicken tacos and the nachos pretty much had the same grilled chicken with some kinda thai chili sauce on top.  The tortillas weren't very good..  and the chips were chewy..  Its just odd to have sweet and sour sauce on top of the nachos..  They both were like something scraped together from whatever you'd find in the fridge.

The rib tips were ok.  Not especially good, not especially bad.  

All in all, I had such high hopes for the place and they were super nice.  But the food isn't very good and it sucks that they didn't give me part of my order.  Shoulda known when the door was locked and you had to enter through the store next door.
This place is closed down
Our first time at this brand new restaurant and I am please to say it was a first class experience.

We visited for lunch just a couple of days after opening so expected them to still be working things out but everything went smoothly. As a Brit I had to go with their $6 Fish & Chips. For that price I expected a smaller portion but the two pieces of fish were a decent size and it was more than enough for lunch. The fish was tasty and the batter cooked perfectly. Served with Tartar sauce and lemon, these guys understand how to cook my national dish (they even had malt vinegar for the chips ... bloody marvelous!).

My lunch companion enjoyed two 'delicious' fish tacos and also said it was the right amount for lunch. 

Well priced, friendly service and a very cool look to the restaurant makes SoCal Fish Company a place I will be returning to again.
I have been dying for this place to open. Dying. I drive by four times a week on the way to and from work, and we visit the Saturday farmer's market across the street every other week, so the wait was killing me.

Well, it was worth it.

Stopped by a few days into their soft open for takeout lunch. The place is beautiful but small, a feature that gives it the feel of a little hole-in-the-wall beach taco joint. There are only six or eight little tables inside the narrow building, but there's a great patio out back with a dozen or more mister-cooled 4-tops shaded by umbrellas. The staff was friendly, prompt, and seemed eager to become part of the growing downtown Gilbert food scene. 

The blackened grouper tacos were nicely seasoned with a tasty spice blend, but they weren't blackened, if you want to get technical. On the other hand, I don't know how you'd properly blacken a fillet less than an inch or so thick without overcooking it, and I'll take delicious over overcooked any day. The fish portions were ample, and the flavor wasn't drowned out by toppings or sauce, though there were a couple cheese "crumbles" the size of walnuts that I had to break up with my fork. The small (but appropriately-sized) sides of jasmine rice and pinto beans were cooked and seasoned perfectly.

My only knock was the sauce/salsa served on the side. It was plenty tasty, but had a distracting number of inch-long fibrous strands of lemongrass or something similar in it. The flavor was fine, but it could've used another couple pulses in the blender or quick trip through a coarse-mesh strainer.

Hopefully they'll have a takeout menu or website with a full menu by the time I visit again. With fresh food, a nice variety of fish (and other) tacos, and good service, I have a feeling there won't be much room to sit once word gets out about this place.
I give the homemade clam chowder a four out of five stars.....so good - Only thing missing is an ocean view!
My wife and I have been waiting for weeks for the So-Cal Fish Taco Company to open in downtown Gilbert. We are locals who frequent four great restaurants already in that section of town (e.g., Postino, Joe's B.B.Q., Oregano's, and Liberty Market).  

First impression matters: It was crowded on the first Friday night opening. We were told there was a one hour wait.  This helped us decide on takeout.  

The fish tacos were nice and crunchy, but we felt that there could have been more fish sauce & cotija cheese.

The carnitas tacos were a little dry to us.  The beans tasted as if they were canned beans.  In house cooked beans have a fresher taste to them.  

As Parents we were concerned that we didn't see a children's menu.  This could still be in the making, however.    

Service was fast for the to go order. Service was friendly. (Still finding their way in terms of organizing the crowd, but we think that is normal for a restaurant that has just opened.)  

We see this venue becoming a local favorite if they subscribe to the enduring idea that quality drives business and customer service matters.  

Haven't had the clam chowda yet but since we spent ten years in Boston we are ready to offer our thoughts after our next visit.
I was excited to try So Cal before they opened. It's around the corner from my office, and I love a good fish taco. 

I ordered the blackened grouper taco plate, and my mom ordered the ahi tuna taco plate. 

My tacos were good. The fish wasn't technically "blackened" but it was tender and had good flavor. The tortillas were soft and warm and held up to the taco filling. They put just the right amount of cabbage on the tacos. I really enjoyed the baja sauce and cotija cheese. The rice and beans are quite average, no special flavors pop out. They purely serve the purpose of completing the plate.

The ahi tuna in my mom's tacos was WAY overcooked, and had an unappetizing grey hue. It was not pleasant to chew because it was so dry. She mentioned that to the server and his response was "Oh. Ok." and nothing else was done.

I will most likely be back, but not for the ahi tuna.
I have been waiting for this place to open... So, the husband and I finally checked it out tonight. I will say that it wasn't horrible but wasn't GREAT! At first it started out wonderful, as everyone was pleasant and greeted us when we came in. Ordered our food, once again, no problems. 

We ordered some oysters as an app and they were delicious and tasted fresh. This is when the problems started...so our waiter brings our daughters food out and is like "is there anything else?" And we kind of look at him like "yeah, our food.." After a minute of the weird looks he is all "your tacos....WILL BE RIGHT UP!" And he made this face like "oh shit, I forgot." So, we waited and waited and waited.... about  an additional 20 minutes while everyone who got here after us, got served their food before us. Word to the wise.. I am much cooler if you would have told us. We get it, you just opened, we would cut you some slack, if you gave us the chance. 

So, the sun is going down at this point and someone needs to tell them that when the sun starts to set YOU TURN OFF THE MISTERS. It gets cold and wet as opposed to nice like when the sun is up. I heard many people around us complaining about the misters, as well. Also, I don't know if there was some kind of mix up with the servers but we watched two different sets of people get totally forgot about at a table near us. The first couple just straight up left, while we had to sit and listen ( we saw more than one bus boy notice this situation... um hello DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT) to the second set of people complain about the poor service.

By now, we have just got our food and the tacos were good. I got the shrimp tacos and husband got mahi mahi tacos. Neither of us had any complaints about the food. My shrimps were large and cooked great. My daughter got the popcorn shrimp and that was actually really good, very pleasantly surprised. Next, we tried to pay and that took about about 10 minutes to get our check back after our waiter took our card...I don't get why that took so long!? Go run the card and come back.

So, all in all, the food was good. The service just needs some help. My husband said it best, they need an on-duty aware manager (which they did not appear to have) to make sure tables aren't forgot, turn off misters..etc. So..hopefully they see this and use it as constructive criticism because I really did like the ambiance and food..just with a few hitches. But, we will be back. I'm going to give it a few weeks and try again since the food was good.
Pretty good... Not as good as "Wahoos" in California. Very friendly staff, fresh food. Awesome clam strips.
Came for lunch with the wife during their  'soft' opening. I believe the problems we had will be worked out. Wait for a table wasn't bad, got sat outside and had to play musical chairs a bit to not sit in a sunny spot or a spot getting dripped on by the misting system. 

Got the crab cakes to start with, which were excellent. I got the shrimp po-boy, and the wife got the fish and chips.

Fish and chips were a tad to thick on the batter. The shrimp on the po-boy was a corn-meal crusted fried shrimp, pretty good as well.

I dislike tarter sauce, but the 'house' tarter sauce is really excellent!

My only disappointment was the lack of any other 'house' sauces. In all my "So-Cal" fish tacos experiences, each place had an assortment of their very own specialty sauces. The lack of anything but tarter here was a disappointment.

tl;dr 4 stars for now, it's still too new and has some issues to work through, it'll be a 5 star soon enough.
Love this place! Great service and good food. Another great "spot" in downtown Gilbert.
Just returned from SoCal Fish Taco Co.  Very disappointing.  Decor and design was interesting, server good, but that's where it all ended.  Don't think much was made from scratch.  Everything tasted canned, salsa, weak cocktail sauce (more like regular ketchup) beans, tortillas......EVERYTHING.  

Really wanted to like this place.  No flavor/seasonings ... Boring.  Wish it was different.  Shrimp tacos and grouper tacos had no flavor at all.  Shrimp had watery/boiled texture.  Not worth it.  Missed opportunity for this company.
I have been waiting for this new restaurant to open.  Well worth it !   My wife and I were very pleased with their food and service. We had the clam chowder and and Mahi tacos.  So-Cal Fish Taco Company will do well with all the excellent restaurants in downtown Gilbert !
Great little place.  We ordered the fish ceviche, clam strips, cod tacos, and carnitas tacos.  A couple of beers and a sangria as well.  Park in the back and sit outside on the patio.  The service was consistent and above average.  We go to The Farmhouse, across the street, for breakfast all the time.  This place is family owned and has fresh seafood.  Where the hell else are you going to find that anywhere near Gilbert.  All of the food was very good.  We wanted to try a variety since it was our first visit.  The ceviche was tasty but if I'm being super picky it could use a little more seasoning.  I eat ceviche frequently in CA.  Bottomline, good service, good food, seafood from a local joint, and family owned. What more do we all need.
Love the downtown Gilbert area and happy this place opened. Love the decor and the service was good. Very laid back, plastic and paper kinda place. The clam chowder was not as anticipated, wish it had more clams but the shrimp tacos were good. I liked the Cotija cheese and Baja sauce on it. The cheese had a feta taste which give it a little edge. My friend had the fish & chips and said it was very fresh. The Left Coast amber beer was pretty good too.
Went for lunch today.  Got there about 1pm, and was seated within 10 minutes.  Ordered 1/2 dozen oysters and a basket of clam strips.  Oysters were great!  being able to get fresh oysters in Gilbert is a great treat.  Now to the clam basket.  Should have known better, but it's just your standard frozen, chewy breaded clam strips.  They were also way over cooked.  Would be happy to pay more for freshly shucked fried clams.  

Will try tacos and steamers next time.
Seriously good fish tacos!  Walked in at 7 on a Saturday night and was immediately seated.  2 adults, 1 kid, and 1 high chair.  SWEET!  Decor is awesome.  The patio has nice lighting so you're not sitting in the dark or barely able to see what you're eating.  After we were seated it did take about 7 mins for our server to notice us and get our drinks and since we had the extra time we also knew what we wanted to eat.  After that initial wait the service was great though.

On to the food!  Ordered Clam strips for an app. Super yummy.  A tad bit chewy, but the hubs and I didn't mind.  Got the kids' popcorn chicken and fish and chips at that time.  Both got the seal of approval from 2 picky eaters.  One minor thing was that the fries were pretty under done almost inedible.  I don't give them fries that much so we just ate the ones that were done and they couldn't even finish those.  Good sized kids portions even without the fries.  
Grown up meals:  We wanted to try a few items.  Got orders of shrimp tacos, ahi tuna tacos and blackened grouper tacos.  All of them were cooked to perfection!  Nothing was even close to being overcooked, seriously perfect.  While all the tacos were great the blackened grouper was the stand out by far.  The beans were also amazing.  Something as simple as pinto beans and SoCal made them memorable.  The rice was just meh, unfortunately got some uncooked grains in with the cooked, mmmm crunchy goodness, not so much.  The mango salsa was flavorful with a nice kick to it.  I don't know what the 1 star guy was talking about with everything being canned and bland.  The cocktail sauce was a bit ketchupy but that's about it.  Also got a Long Island Iced Tea, good but for $6 it was small at around 10 oz.  

Overall:  nice ambiance, small service and kitchen hiccups with it being new, the tacos are what matter and they are STELLAR!  Will definitely recommend to friends and family and be back frequently.
wow! how refreshing to see a menu with incredible good prices, great selection and to top it off, great! food.  service was great, owner was nice,comfortable indoor or out andi am serious great food.

2nd time to So Cal and it was as great as the last! The Mexican Shrimp Cocktail is packed with big fat fresh shrimp, almost like a ceviche, but very good. I ordered just regular fish tacos and they were delicious, I LOVED THE RICE, just perfect and our waitress was sweet and attentive. Met one of the owners while there, nice guy and excited that we were excited! 

I don't know why anyone would give this place one star, but everything was great! 

Others in my group had the ahi tacos and clam chowder and loved them both.
I must say...I will be back. AZ needs a seafood place other than Red Lobster!! This is the only place I can feel like i'm on a vacation on the beach! Love the decor and feel of the place. Love that there is a large, open patio. Service was slow. Our fried clams came out WITH our dinners. My shrimp tacos were good, but kinda sloppy. The corn tortillas were falling apart and the tacos were not full of flavor like I expected. Next time I will try the fish tacos and oysters. Always looking for some oysters. Oysters in Gilbert??? Come on now! ;) Love it. Having a full bar is great as well. If you don't mind your cheap wine in a lil plastic cup.....go somewhere more fancy, like Postino's next door. We kinda made the mistake of going there after for another glass of wine and the $9-$12 glasses of wine made me wish I was back at So Cal with the $5 wine cup. :) Worth a try trying this place and hope they get better with the seasonings. I may have just ordered the wrong thing. Hope this place stays in business. AZ needs this kinda place!
I was really hoping this was going to be great Mexican food, even if it was seafood.  My wife and I had it for lunch and we were not impressed.  Too bad.
My husband and I went to SoCal for the first time and were greeted immediately and sat right away on the patio (at 5:30 on a Friday). We were approached right away and ordered the shrimp cocktail ($7). It came with 5 large shrimp on ice and was very fresh. The cocktail sauce had a tad too much horseradish for my taste but was still good. We weren't very hungry so we split the Mahi tacos (two for $7), but they were a pretty decent size, larger than street tacos. The fish was fresh and it came with a mango chutney, cotija cheese and some cabbage. They didn't over do the cabbage or toppings and the salsa that came on the side was delicious. Our server was prompt with the bill and we had an overall great experience. I hope they stay consistent and worthy of five stars!
This place is so good! Service was great, love the decor, and the food tasted fresh. I got the shrimp po boy and the only thing it needed was the classic spicy mayo... Great back bone for something that is going to be a local favorite. Definitely coming here again and again!
We were excited to try this place, but were quickly disappointed. The space inside is a TINY corridor, so your server constantly paces up and down alongside your table. The water is Gilbert tap water- blech! Any filter or RO would greatly improve the odor and taste of the water. 

I was still holding hope the fish tacos would save the day. Nope. Rubio's has better fish tacos and they're cheap on Tuesdays. I spent $8 on the Ahi Tacos, and could only stomach two bites. They cooked the heck out of the chunk of Ahi; either this was an accident or they don't use high-quality Ahi which can be served rare. It tasted like canned tuna, and there was hardly any sauce on the tortilla to add flavor. There was NO seasoning on the fish itself. To be fair, my date's Tilapia tacos were well-seasoned thin filets (they advertise a lemon pepper seasoning) and were enjoyable. 

They serve the tacos with a side of rice-a-roni, watery pinto beans and some super hot watery salsa. I love spicy food, and I could not consume this salsa. If you like pinto beans (undrained) from a can, you're in luck. 

We love fish tacos from The Reel Inn in CA, and we get that Gilbert is a long way from any beach. Still, if you're going to name you're restaurant "So Cal Fish Taco Company," please deliver something remotely similar to what you advertise. I hope this restaurant can improve and offer some quality fish tacos to downtown Gilbert.
Very good. I thought $6.00 was high but it is a complete meal. They open a 11 am and I entered at 11:10 am and by 11:40 there we people waiting for a table.
First time, not impressed. Seating is mostly outdoors and with the weather these days not comfortable at all. Water drips on you and your food from the misters. Food is good, but not expectacular for the  prices; chips n salsa are extra. Overall it lacks ambiance and the manger needs to put a smile even during cahos. Orders get mixed up, too many hands taking food to tables.
We were eager to try So-Cal, so last night was the night. Maybe we expected to much from a restaurant that says they " want to give you food that you can get stoked about". 

Ok, it started out good. We got the Oysters on the half shell and some of the Mission Brewery Hefeweizen. The Oysters were fresh and very tasty. The beer, cold and refreshing.

I ordered the mahi tacos, and my husband ordered the shrimp tacos. With each bite we kept saying to each other, is this it? We came here for this? We waited 30 minutes for this?  The tacos did not have much flavor. Tacos from Rubio's taste much better. The beans tasted as if they were out of a can, and whats with white rice with tacos? Is that what they do in So-Cal ?

Maybe the cooks were a little to much in a "California State Of Mind" last night, and forgot the seasonings on the fish.
Tuesday Taco Day !  Woo Hoo ! ! ! 
The Cod Tacos were very very tasty.
My fiance and I decided to try So-Cal Fish Taco Company. Got there and it was a full house. My fiance had the shrimp burrito and I ordered fish n' chips. Waited 20 minutes for our order to arrive. Saw the basket and we both immediately said, "really??". Waited 20 minutes and portions in the basket was sad. Hook up the fries in the basket!! Good food but nothing extrodinary that makes me want to return to this restraunt. Along with that, I thought to myself, "well it is a fish taco joint, I should at least try one of their fish tacos." From reading other reviews and talking to others, So-Cal Fish Taco Company is just another fancy place where over priced average fish taco are being served.
We had been waiting for this place to open for a long time.  Were stoked to see it was open.  Went in on a Thursday night about 7pm and waited about 15 minutes.  It is super small inside, the outside is bigger but hey it's like 110 degrees outside!  They sat us outside but the misters were great.  I didn't mind it at all.  Everyone there seemed like they were enjoying themselves.  We got drinks from our waiter who was really nice.

That was the best thing about it.  We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees.  Our drinks were empty right away and stayed empty.  Then the misters went off...we still had no food after about 40 minutes.  The waiter was nice but he was just too busy to stay on top of all of the customers.  The food all came out at once, appetizers and entrees.  I asked for the misters to be turned back on as it was really hot...some of the other customers were also complaining.  They never came back on.  My fish and chips tasted frozen and everything was just about cold.  My husband said his Mahi tacos were very good.  We asked for more drinks and some sauces that never came.  We spent about 90 minutes there waiting and sweating.  The only positive was the Mahi tacos, so it definitely wasn't worth it.  BIG let down.
Great cod tacos! Really good customer service as well.
SoCal fish company specializes in fish tacos. The restaurant is small inside with seven or eight tables and is nicely decorated with a surfboard and  surfing pictures on the wall. The restaurant is sit down and I believe they may do more business if they had a counter you could order at -it may be quicker. But with that said I was in and out of there within 25 minutes. I ordered the Mahi fish tacos and they were excellently prepared. The fish was perfectly cooked and the tacos had cabbage and a mango salsa over the top. The tacos cost seven dollars and they came with a side of beans which had a nice spicy kick and rice - when you combined them it made a really nice side dish. The tacos were a nice size and it was a very satisfying lunch. I had a ice tea with my meal and the server refilled my ice tea and promptly cashed me out. Although the inside was relatively small there is a nice patio out back that has another 12 tables and also a nice comfy couch area to relax in and to eat your tacos - they also have a mister system out there to cool things off on the patio. I also saw that for dessert they have a delicious looking cookie ice cream sandwich that I will have to try next time. SoCal fish is a nice addition to downtown Gilbert and I will definitely will be returning.
Great dive restaurant, quality food
My family and I live just down the road in Gilbert and were super excited to see a new restaurant open up in down town Gilbert. We waited about a week after the location opened before stopping by to escape the "grand opening" rush.  We went in early on a Friday night - probably about 5:30 and we just beat the rush. We were immediately seated and offered drinks.  Now please not the seating in this location is pretty sparse unless you are willing to sit outside.  Nice patio seating, but in AZ in the summer I can't do it with young kiddos. Young servers that are nice, but inexperienced and it shows.

We placed our orders and started with the calamari appetizer - I love calamari - but this was kind of a let down. It was okay, but honestly Oregano's calamari is ten times better. So next up we ordered the kids fish and chips, my oldest had the garlic clam appetizer, hubby had the fish and chips and I had the fish tacos (don't recall which kind).  Everything was okay but not great, and portions were so so.  The clams were really good, but half weren't open so not a great deal for the money.  I was still hungry from our order so we decided to try the crab cakes to finish and this was by far the worst. They were gross and mushy with no texture - it kind of tasted like crab straight from the can - other than the crispy outside, no texture and no crab taste at all.

I was really hoping for a great new restaurant when we walked in - at this point I wouldn't return because it really was just OK.
Another great downtown Gilbert eatery.  Great clam chowder, decent beer selections and friendly staff.
Very good food, not *quite* as awesome as Brigantine in San Diego, but definitely good fish tacos.  It's a very laid back atmosphere, which I really liked and seemed almost out of place in Gilbert - which I mean in a good way.  I think the only downside was that it's easy to spend a lot of money on tacos here, since the portions aren't that big and it's not exactly cheap.  They also had the misters on full blast, so I was basically soaking wet outside, but that was a small complaint.

All in all, good food and worth it.  It's a bit expensive for what you get, but not excessively so.  Worth checking out if you're seeing what's around Gilbert...
Finding a good fish taco in Phoenix is difficult, so when I saw a place with fish taco in its name, I was pretty excited.

The fish ceviche tostadas were pretty good, although a little flimsy.  The mahi fish tacos were ok.  They needed more sauce and to change tortillas.

Decent service, although our server did mess up what was on whose check.

I'll be back because I want to try more of their fish tacos.  This place has better fish tacos than most in Phoenix, but if it was in SoCal, I'm not sure I'd come here again.
Maybe I missed something but this place just didn't wow me. It was around lunch time when we went and the place was almost empty. The set up was just awkward since it is such a small narrow space. We walked in from the parking lot and couldn't quite figure out where to go because there was no one around. The outside patio looked great but it was far too hot, maybe it'll be nicer in the cooler months(or month). The place has character, I'll give it that, but comes across as what an interior designer would consider coastal not quite a laid back beach taco place. We ordered a cheese tortilla with shrimp as an appetizer, it was delicious. The fish tacos were just okay. The mahi mahi taco was good but they were pretty bland with the tiniest amount of mango salsa. For a fish taco company I was expecting more, especially for the price.
Cute concept, but very mediocre. We went into this restaurant hoping to find some good mexican food in Gilbert, but were disappointed by the food. We ordered the fish taco, clam chowder, and oyster. The clam chowder and oyster were both below average. The oyster was warm and sort of gross. The clams in the chowder were chewy. The fish taco was average at best. Hard to justify eating here when Joyride is right across the street...
Simple, neat food without trying to overdo the atmosphere. Tilapia tacos had a nice large filet, broiled, not breaded. One of our party reported these are better (and much less expensive) than other fish tacos nearby. Quick, clean service, great price!! Will definitely dine again.
After spending an extended period of time in Mexico, I was struggling to find a fish taco quality in Phoenix that was similiar to what I enjoyed South of the border. The Cod Fish Tacos at So Cal Taco were great !! After eating many Cod FT in the past, the quality of the fish they use is excellent, above par from other local FT places. The Baja Sauce they offer is good, however there was not enough on each taco for my liking. I ordered extra and they were great. The only negative comment I would have would be that they do not offer a spicy salsa. I used my own spicy salsa, which offsets the creamy Baja sauce they offer. So Cal Taco is a WINNER, but PLEASE get a Salsa option with some heat.
UPDATE - Determined they DO have a spicy salsa, however must be requested. This being discovered, SO CAL is THE place in the East Valley for Fish Tacos !!
Gilbert really needs a great fish taco.. And this is it. I can't stop thinking about the calamari appetizer and fish n' chips entree (with the yummy dips) we enjoyed last week. Perfectly crunchiness and flakey meat on the inside of the cod. Temperature of food was piping hot and seasoning was spot on.

Staff was friendly and fairly attentive. Very cool patio furniture, lighting, but misters were a bit too powerful and got us more wet than we wanted. The price was not bad, it was $20 for an app and entree and we gobbled up every last delicious bite that we could muster. Definite return.
I love this place! Server Steele was cool! Mahi tacos were delicious.  Beer prices fantastic, $3.50 for an Ultra.  Arrived at 3:00, Saturday afternoon, got a table immediately.  Cup of Clam Chowder was good. Oysters were very small, but they did give us 7 on a 1/2 dozen order. 
My favorite fish tacos are at South Beach Bar and Grill, Ocean Beach San Diego... SoCal Fish Taco Co had Tacos just as tasty.
Wife and I will be Back.
My wife and I absolutely love SoCal Fish Taco Company. My favorite tacos are the grilled Mahi Mahi. Have also has the cod tacos and calamari fries - also both very good. Price is right, location is great in downtown Gilbert and the staff is friendly. They have a few SoCal craft beers to choose from - really like the Coronado Brewing IPA. 

There are several fish taco shops we like in San Diego, SoCal Fish Taco company is bringing those great tacos to Gilbert. Great work guys, keep it up.
My husband and I were so disappointed in the tacos. Super plain and almost raw tortillas and the flavor was bland. We got the mahi and the grouper and both were not good. The price is affordable, but I would pay more for better flavor and quality somewhere else.
Went back for seconds today and had the mahi tacos. The fish was cooked well, the sauce was great, the salsa much improved, and the rice and beans are still very good. And they had take-out menus for the folks at work!
We had high hopes but were let down. Service was very good. We went at 6ish on a Thursday and were seated indoors right away. Staff was friendly and attentive and we always had full drinks!  Food was just okay. The batter seemed too heavy (fish and chips and cod tacos) and meal was pretty bland. I guess it lacked what I'd call that "fresh" taste. Now I understand that because we live in the desert we will never get fish tacos like they serve in CA but....
The fish is good. The overall plate could be improved greatly. The tortillas need seasoning. The beans are bland. The rice is excellent. Serving in plastic baskets with plastic forks is lame.
Excellent fish tacos, and quick service for take out.  Reasonable prices, and great variety on the menu.  Only 4 stars because they're closed on Sundays, and because the carne asada was only average.  It seems like the carne asada, chicken, and carnitas are only on the menu to provide variety.  Their real specialty is the various fish tacos (cod, grouper, mahi, salmon, etc), so if you go for those, you won't go wrong.
Great place for a decently priced, and light lunch.  Fish tacos are very delicious.  This is a new favorite lunch spot and I can't wait to go when it cools down and sit on the large patio and have a cold beer.
After spending a week in San Diego I had some of the BEST shrimp tacos. And since then I have been constantly craving them, so my boyfriend and I came here hoping they might satisfy that craving. Well we were wrong.

We walked in and were instantly greeted, the host/ waiter told us there was gonna be quiet a wait for inside but they did a small bar to sit us at or we could sit outside. Not really wanting to be in the heat we opted to sit at the small "bar". That small bar was right behind the host counter, the waiter then told us this was actually and additional waiting area for customers. We sat there for not even a minuet before we asked if we could move outside. The "bar" was such a confined space we could barely sit comfortably. The waiter happily obliged, then took us to the patio.

While the patio was hot, it wasn't unbearable with the umbrella, misters, and fans. After over looking the menu, I decided on the shrimp tacos, and he the ahi tuna. They came out fairly quick, which was nice. But the tacos were nothing great. My tortillas were cold, like out of the fridge cold. There wasn't much flavor at all on the shrimp. The rice was white, which was odd, the beans were straight out of the can. What was really unfortunate was the fact the shrimp in my tacos still had a lot of the shell on them. Each bite I was pulling shell out of my mouth, my boyfriends tuna was almost all chewy, and uneatable. 

Needless to say, we won't be going back. There was nothing to bring me back to try their food again. Especially with the subpar service.
First visit to So-Cal, and loved it! We skipped the tacos on this first visit, and opted instead for the clam chowder, steamed clams, and crab cakes.  What a great choice we made, since all were outstanding.  Excellent beer list too.

We're originally from New England, and we've had hundreds of versions of clam chowder.  So-Cal's version is one of the best I've ever had.  The clams were perfect and not rubbery, the broth was just the right consistency, and the seasoning was spot on.  Amazing.

The steamed clams were brilliant.  It's easy to destroy the little gems, but So-Cal hit the nail on the head.  Sweet, succulent, and also cooked to perfection in a nice light buttery broth that did not over power the cherrystone size clams.

The crab cakes were full of crab, with just the right amount of well seasoned binding.  Outstanding.  

Now that we've savor end the "sides",  we'll be back soon to try the many versions of tacos, and other offerings that are sure to exceed our expectations.

GLAD YOU'RE IN TOWN, SO-CAL!!!!  What a great addition to historic downtown Gilbert.
Amazing gourmet tacos at non-gourmet price. Great patio and service. Beer selection limited but cool breweries. Definitely coming back.
I've been wanting to try this place out for awhile now -- being a member of Funktional Fitness, I pass this place daily running my Funk lap! LOL - and finally stopped in for lunch after my workout. I was not disappointed! The Mahi fish tacos were amazing!  Next I'll be trying the "Funk Plate" (not featured on the menu) -- fresh catch of the day and veggies. Excellent food at a great price! *****
Great food, real good prices for what you get.  Mussels were excellent
Stopped in for lunch today and everything was good.  I had the blackened grouper tacos and my girlfriend had the shrimp tacos.  Both were excellent but I lean towards the grouper.  The spicy kick added with the salsa was awesome.  Even the small sides of beans and rice were good.  Very friendly staff, quick service and reasonable price for lunch.  Highly recommend this new downtown Gilbert addition.
I was only impressed with the Seviche (hope i spelled that right). Other than that the place is more about the atmosphere than they are the food. The fish tacos were dry and lacking flavor.
Definitely one of our favorite lunch places.  We have not had a lunch that we haven't really liked.  This is turning into one of our regular spots.
My daughter and i came for lunch today. We parked in the back and walked through the open dining and inside dining on our way to the hostess station. We noticed five or six open tables on our way in. We were surprised to hear from the hostess that there was a 10-15 minute wait to be seated. 

(What? Can i just go sit down at one of the six open tables?) 

We waited and were seated within the promised window. We ordered calimari fries to start, with my daughter ordering fish and chips, and salmon tacos for myself.

The calimari fries came out hot, crispy, and were very tasty. We finished them off quickly. Both sauces were great.

Next delivered, were my daughters fish and chips, and some shrimp and chips that looked yummy, but were not what i ordered. The waiter promised a quick fix. I noticed the patrons at a neighboring table having bewildered looks, and no food on their table, despite being seated before us.

The salmon tacos arrived within five minutes. The fish was near perfectly cooked, the tortillas tender but not frail, overall very delicious. My daughters fish and chips were tasty, good crunch on the outside with tasty fish inside. Chips were reasonable, but not inspiring. The beans and rice that came with my meal were sufficient.

Waitstaff were nice enough, but maybe a little inexperienced, and slow at times. Their willingness to try makes it all good.

The dining experience overall was positive, but i don't know if i would drive any extra miles to dine here. If i happen to be close, ill probably drop in. (Ill bet that i would have given an extra star if there had not been a line with tables empty, and the wrong meal being delivered.)
Excellent food. My wife had the clam chowder and it was fantastic. The Mexicali shrimp cocktail was amazing.  The ahi tuna tacos were very good and so were the grouper tacos.  My wife had the sangria and it was great. They make it homemade and its not that sweet. Its a small place in old town Gilbert and it has a patio. The owner is cool. A must if you are in the area.
We came here today because i was craving for some tacos. I like the chill patio. But it was too cold for me, I have to borrow my bf's jacket. Our server was nice, he keeps on checking on us. We ordered shrimp ceviche for appetizer.. My mouth exploded! It was really good. For the main coarse my bf got shrimp po'boy, It was ok i had better po'boy before at Flavor's of Luisiana. It came with a cocktail sauce, I wish it came with a tartar sauce. I got the mahi tacos, the fish needs a lil seasoning and it was kinda overcooked. The mango salsa was really good it complements the fish, cabbage and the cojita cheese. I was disappointed with my rice because it was cold and hard.. But we will definitely come back for happy hour.
Who knew this little place was going to be this good? The food, quite inexpensive, is VERY good. I had some crab cakes that were as good as any I've had, even when in Baltimore or Boston. The fish tacos were to die for. We left feeling quite full, and the bill was less than $25 for all of us.
Outdoor seating was very nice. Service excellent. The tacos were very good and so was the salmon wrap. Yum!!
This place is awesome. Great tacos, super reasonable, and nice adult beverage selection. They have several craft beers, which is a nice touch for my main squeeze. The cod tacos are super yummy.. They have great happy hr deals too. Only crappy thing is that it's only offered Monday-Thursday. But, great little patio.. And every time I have been, the service was very laid back and friendly.
First visit last night with my good friend and we really enjoyed it!  The staff was very friendly, Jared seated us and Britney was our server.  She made us feel very welcome, helped us with the menu - made a couple of suggestions and checked on us just enough. 

The food was very good.  We tried one each of the carne, blackened grouper, tilapia and shrimp tacos.  They were all deeelish!  The Tilapia had a bit too much lemon pepper seasoning but overall, the whole meal was great, even the rice and beans.  We also tried the Calamari fries and a cup of the chowder...both very yummy! 

Will be back with more friends!
Good service. I had the grouper which was good. My sister had the shrimp tacos which she enjoyed. The salsa was fantastic!
My boyfriend and his family were so excited to try this place out, but we all left completely unhappy.

For starters, once we sat down at a table it took what seemed like forever until we were waited on. Then when we finally place our food orders, it took way too long to come out to our table. Portion were extremely small, as if it came from the kids menu! When we asked for hot sauce, they brought out sriracha (claiming that was all they had), which is fine but considering it's a fish taco company they should have a variety of sauces/salsa for their foods! Then when someone else wanted more hot sauce, our waiter brought out Chulula! Which was really annoying because we were just told the only hot sauce they had was Sriracha. 

When we got our bill in the end we were even more disappointed to see that the each beer was overpriced and cost MORE than one order of our food! That's just ridiculous. Beer wasn't even good for being "specialty" from California.

Definitely wont be returning here again.
I wanted to love it...grew up in Huntington Beach, surfing in Baja (ensenada, rosarita, etc).  Raised at Wahoo's Fish Tacos and have a decent palate when it comes to fish tacos.  

Service was fine.  nice folks, speed was good.  The decor/patio gave me hope.

Our Group Ordered:  Quesadilla.  Shrimp Tacos.  Mahi Tacos.  Blackened Grouper tacos.

Quesadilla:  $4 for 1 store bought tortilla basically warmed in a microwave.  Like you would make for a snack for a toddler at home.  Weak.  

Shrimp Tacos:  decent.  Server said there were 5 shrimp per taco, mine had 3 shrimp.  Much better at cafe rio up the street.

Mahi Tacos:  lacking flavor.  Looked good.  let down.  wouldn't order these again.

Blackened Grouper:  also, lacked flavor, but the best of the 3 i ordered.  Note:   as i understand it, "blackened" is both a way of cooking (using butter/oil to char the fish, plus usually a cajun/pepper spice).  Again....this is NOT Wahoo's "blackened" fish  

Tap water:  awful.  even w/ lemon.  Get drinks...or soda water at least.

I will return, as i want them to succeed....I will try the other taco's and update.

Happy Hour: Mon - Thurs i will try the Cod Tacos...i think they are $1 buck a piece
What to do on a typical work day Wednesday???? That's right, happy hour! SoCal fish tacos was perfect for a mid-week happy hour. They have $1 tacos and some tasty drinks! Check it out and sit on the back patio for a nice relaxing happy hour!
I was really excited for this place, but it was just bad. I got the Fish and Chips and won't be getting it again. It wasn't cooked all the way, wasn't crispy at all and the annoying part was it was $7 for two little pieces of fish and hardly any fries. My date got the fish tacos, but where was the fish? It was all mangos and veggies. Sorry, but were not impressed.
High expectations because of the laid back and chill atmosphere. Little seating inside, cool patio seating. Happy to see they serve cocktails and beer. I ordered crab cakes recommended by our server, they arrived in a bed of oil and luke warm in the center. They tasted like tuna from the Gordon smith guy at the local grocery store. I also ordered a Long Island ice tea, immediately I could tell by the color of the drink it was a mix or they had a first day bar keep.  I tasted it and it actually tasted like ice tea. The server asked if I wanted a substitute and I got a tasty bottled brew. Good looking out, props.  The food was mediocre at best. Hard rice and I swear canned ranch style beans. My date ordered carnitas, I ordered mahi tacos. We should of went to rubios.  

Pros...80's music, cool patio seating, prices, nice server.  

Cons...food, drinks, ugh!
In all fairness, I've only ever had the Cod Tacos but they were so good I came back 3 days in a row for more!  

The fish was crispy and perfectly sized to fill (not spill) the taco.  I'm pretty picky about tortillas but these had a nice texture (not the dry rubbery ones that come from that fish taco chain) and the cabbage / sauce was fresh and tasty.  I couldn't stop thinking about these tacos and had to go again... and again.  

The price was right, about 7 bucks for the two tacos and 2 sides - rice (which I liked and typically don't) and the beans (which I really liked).  

For me, the portion was perfect for lunch, just enough that I could barely poke it all into my smallish appetite but not so much that I had more than a bite or two left.

I called in my order all 3 times and it was ready in like 8 minutes, fresh and packaged really conveniently for a quick lunch in the car (parked, of course).

The décor is really modern, sleek and inviting - the patio looks amazing and I'd love to try sometime when I have more time.

Parking was ample in back, there is a large parking lot and that's where you enter.
My wife and I love So-Cal Fish Tacos! We ate there three times in one week a few months back! The cod tacos are the best but you really can't go wrong with anything on their menu and we have tried most of it! Make sure and get the ice cream cookie sandwiches if they have them in stock!
The atmosphere is cute, and overall a good location. I went here a couple days ago and ordered the cod with fries. The pricing seemed competitive, however, the food didn't wow me. It was alright though.
Went to SoCal for the 1st time tonight for date night and we loved it!  I had the Mahi Fish Tacos - I thought they were great.  Not too fishy, tasted fresh and the mango salsa and baja sauce was yummy!  My husband had the mussels, oysters on the half shell and crab cakes.  He was in heaven the whole time.  We aren't into specialty beers so we just had Coronas which is perfectly fine with us.  Loved the atmosphere and our waiter Ryan was super nice.  We already have plans to go back next Friday!
This place is delicious! It may be tiny but the patio is amazing. The food was astoundingly good. I wished I could eat more. I love the selection for the tacos and the fact that you can mix and match. I had the Shrimp and the Cod. I preferred the shrimp but I see why the Cod is a big seller. Our server was super sweet and helpful. I can't wait to go back for happy hour!
Nice outdoor patio area and we have always had good service.  Nice variety of Fish Tacos and their Shrimp Ceviche was very good didn't like their Margaritas so we now stick to beer.
If you're looking for a casual place to hang out with a relaxing patio, this spot is it. Great prices and the fish tacos are yummy. So is the fish n chips and the ice cream sandwich for dessert. My daughter gives this place two thumbs up and she is not easy to please!
Yum. Blackened grouper tacos. Yum. Mahi tacos ate good if you eant something milder. All that was missing was the sand.
3 stars for now. Went for lunch. Clam strips were awesome !  Lightly battered n crunchy. Cod tacos were a bit dry. Queso fresco was good but they needed more sauce. The place has a nice vibe. I'll try it again if I'm in the area.
Tried the Mahi Tacos. Served with beans and rice. Rice was good but the beans were nothing special.  The tacos were refreshing.
My only complaint was the owner/manager had a bit of an attitude and kept criticising the servers, who I thought were doing a fine job.
I give them two stars because 1, the hostess was nice & 2, the decor was refreshing... 
Our waiter could have been friendly enough to deserve a bigger tip but at least he was attentive enough to refill our drinks a few times. 

For starters we ordered the $7 calamari fries. It was DELICIOUS. The pieces were thick and the batter was light enough. It came with a side of yummy aioli sauce & marinara, which I thought was a little odd.

I ordered the shrimp Po boy. It was disappointing. Three medium deep-fried shrimp with the tail still on, in between large pieces of white bread. Lettuce, onion & tomatoes came on the side. The tartar sauce was bland. The seasonless fries was the only good part of the dish. 

My other half ordered the fish and chips. It came with two medium size pieces of deep-fried cod and french fries. All you taste is the oil. That too was very disappointing.

If my commute wasn't  30 minutes away from Phoenix I would check out the happy hour since they do offer one dollar cod and tilapia tacos.
This place was recommend think I expected better. I had the ahi tuna tacos and it was cold. Very bland tasting. The salsa really didn't have any flavor to it and margarita I've had better
I had heard and read about how great this place was. Reality didn't match the hype. I had the calamari. It was okay and for $9, I expected a larger portion. The cod tacos were okay as well. A little too much breading. I will say the clam chowder was very good. My son had the fish and chips. He really liked it. Overall experience was okay; food was average and service was good. Id go back and try it again, but it is a bit over hyped.
Best ceviche, best tacos, awesome outdoor patio, great shark tacos, great fish and chips! Only think wish they carried local beers and did bloody Mary's! Our new favorite spot!
Saw this place, was excited to try it, until I heard they sold SHARK tacos. Shame on you So-Cal for doing this. Will never go there now.
Have been here a few times. Happy hour was great. Food is good beer prices ok. Waitress screwed up the 2 tabs that our party had. We told the waitress and she said even Pabs the owner could not fix them. My wife said you can go try.  The waitress responded "your not my mother". That was shocking but it gets better. The manager Matt corrected our tabs. Then we paid and he came back. Upon his return we asked him about the "mother" comment. His reply was that they see their staff as equals to the paying customers and the waitress felt insulted that we noticed she screwed up our tabs and requested that they be fixed. We were talking down to her and it was ok that she made the mother comment. Even my ultra relaxed friend (the owner of the other wrong tab) was pissed. It is the first time in my life that a manager of a restaurant told four of the seven people in the place he did not need their business. At that point I openly told Matt he sucked as a manager and we would not return. Matt must not know Slow Ride is across the street. It is rare that I get out to happy hour and get the wife to drive. Like Matt says our time and money are better spent across the street.
This place has a great variety of fish tacos and a nice patio to enjoy when the weather is nice.  My daughter particularly liked the couches outside. I got to relax for hours, drink a couple of tasty beers, and enjoy some fish tacos...no complaints there. 

The fish tacos tasted like they were on white corn tortillas, so had a nice mild flavor. We tried the mahi, tilapia, and shrimp tacos. The shrimp were easily my daughter's favorite.  They were good tacos, but not the best I've tasted. 

Ultimately, I will be back, beer in one hand , fish taco in the other.
Great environment and outdoor seating these limited spring days. Wonderful service but mediocre food. Enjoy drinks but skip the bland food.
This place is great! I've been several times now and it's becoming a favorite. On top of good food, the outdoor seating area is nice during the cooler months. I've tried the mahi and salmon tacos, the mahi is now my go to. The last two visits we split an ice cream sandwich lightly rolled in sea salt, wow! Delicious!
The Republic gave this place 4 stars and i agree.  Unique little place.  Food is fresh, service is good, and the patio is great too.  Went for lunch with my wife and we were impressed.  Two mahi tacos stuffed with mahi mahi and fresh mango for 7 bucks!  You would be hard pressed tonget street tacos at that price.  We had clam chowder for 3 dollars that was house made.  The chowder was excellent.  Go to Paradise Bakery for canned chowder and pay twice that price.  Also had the steamed clams.  We got two dozen clams in a bucket for 9 dollars!  They were fresh and sand free.

I will be straight forward here.  This is the kind of place you'd find in a coastal town except the quantity is better.  If your looking for a casual, flip flop wearing locale to have awesome food and a cold Corona this is the place.  Local small business with fresh made food.  Highly recommended!

Also, they have a solid selection of San Diego micro brews.
It's always good and well priced.
Chicken tacos....
tasted like canned chicken ! 
It was dry & had NO flavor at all - not even a little salt or pepper. Tried adding the watery salsa but even that didn't make the chicken moist. And as for adding flavor the "salsa" was so hot that there was nothing to taste - just heat - and not in a good way.

The tortillas were mushy, cold and falling apart.  They looked & tasted like they were just out the bag from walmart. 

The beans are most likely right from the can and not even drained -- just mushy, wet and again flavorless.

The rice --- eh, not a lot of flavor and was still a little crunchy tasting.

Mexacali Shrimp Cocktail....
Flavor wasn't bad  but it was VERY watery and could have been a little more chunky with tomatoes. 
The shrimp at least tasted good though.
Served with salty tortilla chips and several of those tasted stale.
If this was a little more chunky it would do well in a bread bowl with the shrimp on the edge of the bread.
Cool hangout place and great food! My healthy recommendation is Ceviche Tostadas! I usually order 2 of each (2 Fish and 2 Shrimp) and I take the tostadas (shells) out. Lots of food for a good $. My kids love the fish and chips and clam chowder!
Short & Sweet

Impeccable fresh oysters!
Great fried Shrimp!
Good beer.
Fresh, though simple salad.
Ask for your fries "well done".
I wish they had gelato for the perfect dessert.
I always prefer the Mom and Pop shops to anything from a chain.  This place is a perfect example of the reason why:
1) Value: The prices here are more than fair.  We got out with our family of four for less than 35 bucks.
2) Quality:  The fish was all beyond fresh. The garnishes and tortillas were the same.  Very fresh and very tasty.
3) Service:  Casual and genuine.  The drinks never had a chance to get empty and the kids never had a chance to get bored waiting.  
4) Taste:  I personally had the mahi tacos.  Wow!  They were jammed with fish and the mango salsa paired with them was fantastic.  
This place is a must try.  Worth a drive if you aren't in the neighborhood.  My kind of food!
Didn't think it was that great. Over priced even for downtown Gilbert. Went by the owner but he didn't say anything or acknowledge.  I guess they don't need the repeat business.  Won't be back
The shark tacos were great. The slaw they put on the tacos is better than most baja mexican joints. I didn't like the ceviche. It wasn't bad, it just didn't wow me.
Food was terrific!  Service was fabulous.  Went for the first time and Ill definitely be coming back!
Best Fish Tacos around!!! owner is a true food fanatic and gets it as his family owns another High Quality Seafood Restaurant that has been around 25 plus years... Incredible Fish and Chips at a great price for a quick lunch!! best homemade cocktail sauce around!! great atmosphere and location!! always upbeat staff and treated very well and food is always prefect and ready to go on a phone call, walk in, or sit down meal!!! Highly recommended!!!! great chips and salsa and true  baja shrimp cocktails, along with a variety of other meals!!!!
Nice quaint location in downtown Gilbert. Limited indoor seating, has outdoor seating available, ample parking in public parking area behind the restaurant. 

Their menu is ample providing many choices. I tried their combo Mai and Blackened Grouper fish tacos, delicious and light fish, I wish the beans and rice was a larger serving. 

Overall good experience, great prices. Recommend highly if you like fish tacos.
The fish is good here and I like the outdoor patio area,  the atmosphere really  feels like you are in California!
Great happy hour Mon-Thurs from 3-6pm! Tacos average $2. I got the chicken and tilapia tacos, both were delicious but not to be outshined by the fish ceviche tostada for $2.50! Everything tastes remarkably fresh. 

Love the decor and outdoor patio. For a little while,  I forgot I lived in Arizona. I felt like I was eating at a establishment near the beach in California.
This is a great restaurant. The service is always good also.
The patio is a special place to sit outside and eat. I've eaten here many times and never been disappointed!
I love the food and I've eaten there frequently but I've found it's better to stick to to-go's. Everytime I've eaten in, the service is terrible. This last time I brought a group of friends, 5 total. 3 got there before the others and ordered chips and salsa, drinks and some tacos. They had to ask 4 times for the chips. Then when meals for all of us came, they brought them out two at a time. The 5th meal didn't come out for a full 15 minutes. I worked in food service and it was unacceptable to bring out partial orders. My friend sat there waiting for her meal. Server wasn't attentive (we asked for napkins several times, drinks weren't refilled). Also, as we sat on patio, a busser went to take down an umbrella from a table to fit a larger party (push the tables together). He ended up hitting a lady at another table and we were ducking and moving out of the way. A guy at another table offered to help him but he said no and kept trying to move it. It was something out if a comedy routine (turn with a large item, people ducking under). 

They also seemed to have a problem with their phones for a while. Either it would be busy, or the call would disconnect after ringing a few times. They don't have a hold system as I called one time for an order and the server asked me to hold on. It was then obvious he just placed the phone down and I could hear everything going on. I stayed on the line for about 10 minutes and by then was in the area and just went in to place the order. When I walked in, the phone was still off the hook and now had the dial tone. So for at least 15 minutes no one would have been able to get through. 

So in short I love this place for the food, but there needs to be a lot more attention to the service and the ultimate atmosphere.

Between myself, friends and fiancé, we've had a few of the tacos, appetizers, soup. Everything is pretty good. Tacos are awesome. The po boy sandwhich was literally a roll with a piece of fried fish on it. No sauces, nothing else. While presentation looked like it came from Denny's. It paled in comparison to tacos. 

2 stars for service. 4/5 for food.
The food was fantastic, very Baja Cali style but so tasty. The beers were ehh and the servers were friendly. Just a little pretentious...just a little. But seriously who cares with food that great. I would go during the day next time Bc the restaurant is as dim as a Hollister store and doesn't feel that inviting. But I'll def go there again.
Excellent prices and great food.  Had the cod tacos and chicken taquitos, finished off with a great handmade ice cream sandwich for dessert.  Great for lots of friends and families.  Sat out on the back patio under some umbrellas - middle of June in the Az and the umbrellas worked great.  Kids enjoyed it, finished their plates.  Loved this place!
Just ordered the Shrimp Tacos.  Service was great - the food came out quickly.  Food is awesome.  I don't normally like pinto beans but these are awesome!  I came for lunch - but I just told my wife I'd be down to go back for dinner! :)
There are two taco places on Gilbert Rd in close proximity and in my opinion this is the better of the two.  It is a kick back place where you get a bottle of beer and some great fish tacos. 

Nothing fancy about it but it is some of the best fish tacos I've had locally. The mahi mahi tacos are my favorite and you have to try the clam chowder as well.  My sister drives all the way from Phoenix to get their food.

I noticed that they have happy hour and I haven't had a chance to try that yet but it is definitely on the list.
Great seafood and service! I dont leave reviews unless they justify my time. So Cal fits the bill. Good prices and nice ambience.
YumYumYUM! I've been here twice in two weeks, and it's so yummy. Joyride Fish Taco is across the street and is good too, but way more expensive than this place. 

Great prices, many options, and awesome tacos.

The mahi mahi, grouper, and shrimp tacos all rock and are very flavorful. Tacos come with a small side of beans and rice and a salsa (I'm guessing homemade) that's spicy and awesome.
Cute boys & great food! The grouper fish tacos are AMAZING. I tried a few appetizers and wasn't disappointed. Overall great food for a good price.  Love.
Great servers... Very decent prices... Had clam chowder which was real treat... Fish and chips were pretty good... Would definitely come back..
Calamari was great, lobster taco was amazing and fish and chips were very good. Homemade cocktail sauce, tarter sauce and salsa all worth the trip alone.

Awesome local joint with awesome food and a fun atmosphere.
Been wanting to try this place out for a while and so glad I finally did. The service was excellent, the food was excellent, and the menu is fairly priced. I ordered a Thresher Shark Taco, Lobster Taco and a shrimp taco with mussels to start SOOO Good!
