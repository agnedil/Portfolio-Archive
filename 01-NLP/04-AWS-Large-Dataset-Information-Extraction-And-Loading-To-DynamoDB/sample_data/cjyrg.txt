Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:HEALTH HAZARDS GIVEN ON THIS DATA
    SHEET APPLY TO CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID. HAZARDS
    OF DILUTE SOLUTIONS MAY BE REDUCED, DEPENDING UPON THE
    CONCENTRATION. DEGREE OF HAZARD FOR THESE R EDUCED CONCENTRATIONS
    IS NOT CURRENTLY ADDRESSED IN THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE. INHALATION:
    CORROSIVE! INHALATION OF VAPORS CAN CAUSE COUGHING, CHOKING,
    INFLAMMATION OF THE NOSE, THROAT AND UPPER RESPIR ATORY TRACT AND
    IN SEVERE CASES, PULMONARY EDEMA, CIRCULATORY FAILURE AND DEATH.
    INGESTION; CORROSIVE! SWALLOWING HYDROCHLORIC ACID CAN CAUSE
    IMMEDIATE PAIN AND BURNS OF THE MOUTH, THROAT, ESOPHAGUS ( EFFECTS
    OF OVEREXPOSURE)
Effects of Overexposure:HEALTH HAZARDS: AND GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT. MAY
    CAUSE NAUSEA, VOMITING AND DIARRHEA, AND IN SEVERE CASES, DEATH.
    SKIN CONTACT: CORROSIVE! CAN CAUSE REDNESS, PAIN AND SEVERE SKIN
    BURNS. CONCENTRTED SOL UTIONS CAUSE DEEP ULCERS AND DISCOLOR SKIN.
    EYE CONTACT: CORROSIVE! VAPORS ARE IRRITATING AND MAY CAUSE DAMAGE
    TO THE EYES. CONTACT MAY CAUSE SEVERE BURNS AND PERMANENT EYE
    DAMAGE. CHRONIC: LONG-TERM	EXPOSURE TO CONCENTRATED VAPORS MAY
    CAUSE EROSION OF TEETH. LONG TERM EXPOSURES SELDOM OCCUR DUE TO THE
    CORROSIVE PROPERTIES OF THE ACID.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:PERSON WITH PRE-EXISTING SKIN
    DISORDERS OR EYE PROBLEMS OR IMPAIRED RESPIRATORY FUNCTION MAY BE
    MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE EFFECTS OF THE SUBSTANCE.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:FIRST AID PROCS GIVEN APPLY TO CONC SOLNS. EXPOS TO DILUTE
    SOLNS MAY NOT REQ THESE EXTENSIVE FIRST AID PROCS. INHAL:REMOVE TO
    FRESH AIR. IF NOT BRTHG, GIVE ARTF RESP. IF BRTHG DFCLT, GIVE OXYG.
    GET ME D ATTN IMMED. INGEST:IF SWALLOWED, DO NOT INDUCE VOMIT. GIVE
    LG QTYS OF WATER. NEVER GIVE ANYTHING BY MOUTH TO UNCON PERSON. GET
    MED ATTN IMMED. SKIN: IMMED FLUSH SKIN W/PLENTY OF WATER FOR AT LST
    15	MIN WHILE REMOVING CONTAM CLTHG & SHOES. GET MED ATTN IMMED.
    WASH CLTHG BEFORE REUSE. THOROUGHLY CLEAN SHOES BEFORE REUSE.
    EYES:IMMED FLUSH EYES W/PLENTY OF WATER FOR AT LST 15 MIN, LIFTING
    LOWER & UP PER LIDS OCCASNLY. GET MED ATTN IMMED.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Extinguishing Media:WATER OR WATER SPRAY. NEUTRALIZE WITH SODA ASH OR
    SLAKED LIME.
Fire Fighting Procedures:USE NIOSH APPROVED SCBA AND FULL PROTECTIVE
    EQUIPMENT . STRUCTURAL FIREFIGHTER'S PROTECTIVE CLOTHING IS
    INEFFECTIVE FOR FIRES INVOLING HYDROCHLORIC ACID. STAY AWAY FROM
    ENDS OF TANKS. COOL TANKS  WITH WATER SPRAY UNTIL WELL AFTER FIRE
    IS OUT.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:NOT CONSIDERED TO BE A FIRE HAZARD. MAY
    REACT WITH METALS OR HEAT TO RELEASE FLAMMABLE HYDROGEN GAS. NOT
    CONSIDERED TO BE AN EXPLOSION HAZARD.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:VENT AREA OF LEAK OR SPILL. WEAR APPROP
    PERSONAL PROT EQUIP AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 8, EXPOS CTLS/PERSONAL
    PROT. ISOLATE HAZ AREA. KEEP UNNEC & UNPROT PERS FROM ENTERING.
    CNTN & RECOVER LIQ WHEN POSS.  NEUT W/ALKALINE MATL (SODA ASH,
    LIME), THEN ABSORB W/INERT MATL (EG, VERMICULITE, DRY SAND, EARTH)
    & PLACE IN CHEM WASTE CNTNR. DO NOT USE COMBUST MATLS, SUCH AS SAW
    DUST. DO NOT FLUSH TO (SUPDAT)
Neutralizing Agent:NEUTRALIZE WITH ALKALINE MATERIAL (SODA ASH, LIME).

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:STORE IN COOL, DRY, VENTD STORAGE AREA
    W/ACID RESIST FLOORS & GOOD DRAINAGE. PROTECT FROM PHYSICAL DMG.
    KEEP OUT OF DIRECT SUNLIGHT & AWAY FROM HEAT & INCOMPAT MATLS. DO
    NOT WASH OUT CNTNR & USE IT FO R OTHER PURPOSES. WHEN DILUTING,
    ALWAYS ADD ACID TO WATER; NEVER ADD WATER TO ACID.
Other Precautions:WHEN OPENING METAL CNTNRS, USE NON-SPARKING TOOLS
    BECAUSE OF POSSIBILITY OF HYDROGEN GAS BEING PRESENT. PROTECT FROM
    FREEZING. CNTNRS OF THIS MATERIAL MAY BE HAZARDOUS WHEN EMPTY SINCE
    THEY RETAIN PRO DUCT RESIDUES (VAPOR, LIQUID); OBSERVE ALL WARNINGS
    & PRECAUTIONS LISTED FOR PRODUCT.
