Obama abandoned Israel and buddied up to Iran--Israel's mortal enemy.  Is that the type of President Jews want?  Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons.  But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion.

      "I find all sorts of things wrong with this article and perspective. Trump has been the greatest Presidential ally for Israel, possibly since its creation. Obama abandoned Israel and buddied up to Iran--Israel's mortal enemy. Is that the type of President Jews want? Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons. But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion. Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause. The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump.

I guess I'd prefer that golden eagles not get killed, and some other birds as well, but I really don't care that much.  And I don't care about the lives of the individual birds.  These are abstractions to me; they don't exist in any real way.  However, I'm concerned about humans once again barging into something without fully understanding its repercussions.  It was the same with coal and oil, wasn't it?  How is this any different, except maybe in scope or scale or something.  I also always wonder what the weather effects are of wind turbine farms.  Do we understand that?  Is that contributing to torandoes and more severe storms?  I'm sure no one understands that either.\n",

      "'Abhorrent' bottle attack on young Rangers fan before Celtic game —  Police have described a bottle attack on an 11-year-old Rangers fan before Sunday's League Cup semi-final game with Celtic as \"abhorrent\". Kraig Mackay suffered a large cut to his head after being hit by the bottle while walking in Aitkenhead Road, Glasgow, at about 14:00 on Sunday. Pictures on social media showed Kraig with a large gash and a bandage on his head. Police have appealed for help to find the person responsible. The boy was walking with his family and a number of other Rangers fans when a bottle was thrown at the group. It struck the 11-year-old on the head and he was taken by ambulance to the Royal Hospital for Children where he was treated for a large cut and later released. 'Totally unacceptable' Police Scotland Ch Supt Brian McInulty said: \"The incident involving the assault of the 11-year-old boy whilst he was walking to the game is completely unacceptable and understandably has shocked the communities of Glasgow. \"Let's be clear - this was an attack on a young boy who could possibly be left with a scar. This is abhorrent, and the person, or persons, responsible need to be caught.\" Det Insp Colin Hailstones added: \"At the time, the area was obviously very busy and there are people who will know who is responsible for this crime and I would appeal to them to come forward to police with their information. \"This attack is totally unacceptable and although we don't believe that the young boy was specifically targeted, the bottle was deliberately thrown at the crowd of supporters who were simply making their way to the match to enjoy the game.\" Ibrox mascot Rangers manager Mark Warburton said Kraig would join the club as the mascot at Ibrox on Wednesday night and watch the game from the directors' box. Ch Supt McInulty added: \"Whilst the majority of genuine football fans behaved well yesterday, from a crowd of 50,697, there were 18 arrests for minor public disorder including people having had too much to drink.\" A 27-year-old man was arrested in connection with an alleged sectarian breach of the peace and a 17-year-old man was arrested for allegedly being in possession of a pyrotechnic device. A further 16 men, aged between 17 and 68 years, were arrested for minor public order offences. The men are expected to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court. The game was won 1-0 by Celtic.\n",

      "'Afghan Girl' in iconic National Geographic photo arrested in Pakistan —  Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN)The Afghan woman, whose striking green eyes in a National Geographic cover photo made her face known around the world, is under arrest in Pakistan. Sharbat Gula was 12 when photographer Steve McCurry captured his iconic image of her living in a refugee camp for Afghan nationals in Peshawar, Pakistan. Now in her 40s, Sharbat Gula -- also known as Sharbat Bibi -- was arrested in Peshawar on Tuesday for falsifying documents and staying illegally in Pakistan, officials said. If convicted, Gula could be jailed for up to 14 years or be deported, said Zia Awan, a human rights lawyer based in Karachi. Sharbat Gula in the women's jail of Peshawar. Last year, Gula was arrested on similar charges, but was later released. McCurry, the photographer, said he is committed to helping her legally and financially. \"I object to this action by the authorities in the strongest possible terms,\" he said in a statement. \"She has suffered throughout her entire life. Her arrest is an egregious violation of her human rights.\" Mounting pressure on refugees The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) in Afghanistan told CNN it would only be able to assist in the case if Gula registers as a refugee. \"Sharbat Gula falls under the 'undocumented migrants' umbrella,\" said Duniya Khan with the agency's Pakistan office. \"The UNHCR cannot intervene since she is not a registered refugee.\" The International Organization for Migration (IOM), which assists undocumented migrants, says the arrest -- although legal if the ID card is proven to be false -- is symptomatic of the mounting pressure on Afghan refugees in Pakistan to return home. \"It is a sign of the times in Pakistan, that it has now reached someone who was something of a celebrity in the '80s, someone more high profile than the average,\" said Nicholas Bishop, project development officer for the IOM in Afghanistan.

      "'My whole family has been wiped out': Victims of Dreamworld tragedy revealed as witnesses recall heartbreaking cries of girls who watched their mothers die on Thunder River Rapids ride —  Two young girls, aged 10 and 13, were miraculously thrown to safety from the doomed Thunder River Rapids ride at Dreamworld on Australia's Gold Coast and watched in horror as the four adults in their raft were killed. A malfunction with the ride's conveyor belt is suspected to have caused the six-person raft to flip, crushing and drowning two men, aged 38 and 35, and two women, aged 42 and 32, about 2.20pm on Tuesday. Those killed include Canberra woman Kate Goodchild, 32, her brother Luke Dorsett, 35, his partner Roozi Araghi, 38, and another woman.  The New Zealand Herald has named Cindy Low, 42, from Kawerau, as the fourth victim. She was believed to be holidaying in Queensland at the time.  One of the children thrown to safety from the raft was Ms Goodchild's daughter. She howled in horror as she watched her mother die, according to News Corp.  Top police officials said it was 'almost a miracle that anybody came out of that', saying they may have escaped through 'the providence of God or somebody'.   Both girls were recovering in hospital on Tuesday night. The tragedy happened after the raft the six people were riding on turned over and flipped, Assistant Queensland Police Commissioner Brian Codd said.   '(It fell) back on top of those persons and those persons (were) variously caught in machinery.' The catastrophe was captured on CCTV cameras and the footage would be reviewed as part of the investigation. The theme park is closed indefinitely.   The mother of the Dorsett siblings, Kim, took to Facebook to express her grief.  'My family have been completely wiped out,' she said. 'I have three children and two of them are now gone. 'My eight-month-old granddaughter is never going to know her mother and that truly breaks my heart.' Ms Dorsett's husband, daughter, and newborn baby girl, had to be consoled by paramedics. Families were being informed of the tragedy on Tuesday night.    Radio broadcaster Dom Knight, an old university friend of Mr Araghi, remembered him as a 'passionate, funny, brilliant man with an unquenchable love of retro pop'.  Other friends described Mr Araghi and Mr Dorsett as the 'most loving couple', 'intelligent and witty, filled with life and hope'.   Witnesses to the tragedy said they saw a young girl was wandering alone at the ride's exit calling out for her mum shortly afterwards.  A woman could be seen 'hanging by her foot, crushed from the ride'. Bystander Claire Wooley said she helped a child she believed was the daughter of one of those killed,Sunshine Coast Daily reported. Another witness said 'there were kids on board screaming while their mum was like trapped under'. A malfunction with the ride's conveyer belt was believed to have caused the tragedy, Queensland Ambulance acting supervisor Gavin Fuller told a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. flume be turned over and flipped, resulting in it falling back on top of those persons and those persons being variously caught in machinery - and I don't want to go into too much graphic detail.    The four adults and two children were in a raft that collided with an empty raft that had become stuck, Courier Mail reported. Reports suggest their raft flipped, crushing two of the adults. The other two adults were trapped in the conveyor belt underwater. Visitors to the theme park have claimed the ride had been plagued by mechanical issues earlier in the day. Lisa Walker said she had tried to board the ride with her daughter Kaylah, 25, and said rafts were piling up against each other, she told The Australian. 'Earlier in the day it had broken down,' the same witness told Sydney Morning Herald. 'It had broken down and we went back a couple of times to this particular ride. 'We were standing on the bridge watching and the water had stopped. 'There was no rapids.' The accident happened 10 minutes after she and her daughter left the scene, Lisa said. Another woman told Nine News engineers were called to the ride earlier in the day. 'They drained all the water out and then had to refill it back up, and then we were allowed to go. But, yeah, we were stuck there for about 30-40 minutes at least,' the woman said. Todd Reid, Inspector Regional Duty Officer, could not confirm reports the ride had been faulty earlier in the day. 'I'm not aware [if that's true], but that will be part of the investigation and that will be one of the aspects we will be looking at,' he said. The horrific accident happened towards the end of the ride. Mr Fuller, of Queensland Ambulance, would not elaborate on any of the injuries the four adults suffered. 'They sustained injuries incompatible with life,' he said. Dreamworld staff had drained water from the ride in an attempt to save the trapped passengers and desperately tried to treat two of those injured before paramedics arrived. The park was evacuated and hundreds of shocked patrons streaming out. Dreamworld will be closed until further notice. CEO of the theme park, Craig Davidson, said the team was 'deeply shocked and saddened by this and our hearts and our thoughts go to the families involved and to their loved ones'. The ride's annual maintenance, conducted by independent workplace health and safety engineers, had been done just three days before the accident, a Dreamworld spokesperson said. A certification was provided, which Daily Mail Australia has requested a copy of. Specialist forensic and scientific officers, as well as detectives were at the scene on Tuesday evening. Investigators have been interviewing a number of witnesses at nearby police stations with support services also being offered. The State Coroner and the Queensland Government's Forensic Pathologist also attended the scene. Police will prepare a report for the coroner. Dreamworld owners Ardent Leisure shares fell 7.8 per cent on news of the tragedy. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he was 'very saddened to learn of the tragic accident'. 'Theme parks are a place for family fun and happiness, not tragedy. This is a very, very, sad, tragic event. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who lost their lives,' Mr Turnbull said in a statement. 'This is a very sad day, and we trust there will be a thorough investigation into the causes of this accident over the days to follow.' Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said the news was 'heartbreaking'. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said she had heard the scene was 'horrific' and said counsellors were being rushed to Dreamworld to calm the 'many, many witnesses'. Gold Coast Mayor Tom Tate said it was a 'very sad day for our city' in a statement. 'Our thoughts are with the families of those affected – and the emergency staff in attendance.' Shocked US Olympic gold medalist Matthew Centrowitz said he had been on the ride just a few minutes before the accident. 'Dude, just got off a ride 15 mins ago that has 1 person seriously injured and 2 others trapped,' he wrote on Twitter. A similar Dreamworld ride called Rocky Hollow Log Ride was shut down in April for a weekend after a man almost drowned, according to The Courier Mail. A Queensland Ambulance spokeswoman said at the time the man swallowed water after he fell from the ride. The Thunder River Rapids ride was built in 1986 and is said to be a 'moderate' with a maximum speed of 45km/h, according to Dreamland. Visitors as young as two-years-old are allowed to go on the ride. People sit on circular rafts that seat six.\n",

      "'Swam for their life': More survivors of Leviathan II tragedy sue tour operator —  The latest lawsuit filed against a Tofino whale-watching tour company whose boat capsized last year, killing six people, paints a terrifying picture of the moments immediately after the vessel capsized. In his claim, plaintiff Robert Goodfellow says he was on the portside of Leviathan II’s upper deck when the captain positioned the boat in shallow water over a reef near Vargas Island on Oct. 25, 2015. The captain had stopped for the purpose of viewing sea lions, but the ship was “pitching and rolling in significant breakings created by the shallow reef,” according to court documents. That same day, Parks Canada reported wind speeds of up to 30 knots with recorded wave heights of two to three metres in the waters off Tofino, the suit says. Goodfellow was seasick and about to move into the lower enclosed cabin of the boat around 3:45 p.m. when a swell rose into a larger wave over the reef, striking the starboard side of Leviathan II and causing it to heel over. The vessel rolled violently, tossing around some passengers including the other plaintiff in the suit, Marya Levin. Goodfellow struck a portside rail and was “suddenly fully submerged for a considerable period of time beneath the sea as the vessel rolled,” the suit says. “Robert and Marya remained submerged below the sea water out of breath and in shock until they were able, eventually, to see ocean surface light and swam for their life to the surface,” it says. Both surfaced near the vessel near two other passengers named in the suit as “Mr. Thomas and his son Stephen,” who were seated on the upper deck, referencing 50-year-old David Thomas and his 18-year-old son Stephen, both British nationals. “Marya pushed a second cushion toward Mr. Thomas and his son, who was clinging to him, but as the overturned sinking vessel drifted toward them, they were in danger of being struck by rotating propellers,” the suit says. The pair say they kicked hard away from the vessel while clutching a cushion, but sea conditions were rough. Marya spotted a lifejacket floating near the wave break on the rocks and reached over a passenger’s body to get it, then the pair swam away from the rocks to a life raft about 100 metres away. The pair were surrounded by leaked oil and among the damages specified in the suit, say they suffered injuries from breathing and swallowing the oily water. “Through determination and will to survive, Robert and Marya, after some 45 minutes, reached the lifeboat where three crew members were already on board,” the claim says. Both are now seeking damages from Jamie’s Whaling Station, the tour operator, due to physical, mental and emotional trauma. They say the capsizing and injuries were caused by the fault, neglect, recklessness, negligence and breach of contract by the company. Among the injuries, Goodfellow says he suffered head trauma, injuries to his knee and left hip, bruising and contusions all over his body, hypothermia and lung-related issues from the oily water. Several other lawsuits have already been filed by survivors of the tragedy. Ian Charles and Jill Zaparyniuk from Edmonton have also filed a suit, detailing their attempts to escape the sinking ship. Two German passengers, Christian and Dirk Barchfield, have filed a class-action suit against company owner Jamie Bray and the boat’s captain, citing post-traumatic stress disorder. None of the allegations in the lawsuits have been proven in court. Jamie’s Whaling Station has called the sinking of the vessel an “act of god.”\n",

Several other lawsuits have already been filed by survivors of the tragedy. Ian Charles and Jill Zaparyniuk from Edmonton have also filed a suit, detailing their attempts to escape the sinking ship. Two German passengers, Christian and Dirk Barchfield, have filed a class-action suit against company owner Jamie Bray and the boat's captain, citing post-traumatic stress disorder. None of the allegations in the lawsuits have been proven in court. Jamie's Whaling Station has called the sinking of the vessel an \"act of god.\"\n",

      "'They Were Just Like Us, and They Lost Everything' —  Can empathy for refugees be taught? A few weeks ago, I scrambled to evacuate my area with the only five items I could grab—my phone, passport, water, money, and medicine—in the 30 seconds before I had to flee. Many of the roughly 65 million refugees, asylum-seekers, and internally displaced people around the world today have had to make panicked choices like these; more than 4,000 have died at sea in overcrowded boats and rafts attempting to reach Europe from the Middle East. On Thursday last week, more than 200 additional people lost their lives in two separate shipwrecks off Libya. But my own “escape” was far away from that, on the safety of the National Mall in Washington, D.C., where Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) had organized the Forced From Home exhibit. The aim was, in part, to put the staggering numbers of the crisis into tangible terms for those of us who don’t have to contemplate actually being forced from home. So I took on the identity of an asylum-seeker from Honduras while my tour guide, Ahmed Abdalrazag, pled with the group to hurry up. If we were really fleeing, he explained, our time would be up and it might be too late. We got on a raft like the ones in which so many have risked, and lost, their lives in recent years—though this one stayed on dry land—and later, we were detained at a fenced border where our various legal classifications determined our future. At each stop, hardships from the journey forced us to give up one item, until we were left empty-handed in front of staged refugee tents—where in real life another series of ordeals await those who make it that far. MSF, or Doctors Without Borders, the international aid group and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, is touring the exhibit through five U.S. cities this fall, with a series of West Coast stops planned for next year. So far, according to an MSF spokesman, more than 17,000 people have attended, including over 3,400 students. MSF provides medical and related humanitarian aid in over 60 countries, often in dangerous circumstances—the group describes its mission as assisting “victims of conflict, natural disasters, epidemics, or healthcare exclusion.” In Syria, Yemen, and Afghanistan recently, MSF-supported hospitals and the people who work there have themselves been victims of conflict. With the Forced From Home exhibit, MSF is trying to communicate, in concrete terms, the reality of people fleeing from those places and elsewhere, including Burundi, South Sudan, and Central America. Official action to mitigate this reality has been frustratingly slow. It has been more than two years since the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) first reported that the number of displaced people worldwide had surpassed the figures following World War II.  But as my colleague Uri Friedman wrote in September, the UN General Assembly only recently held its inaugural Summit for Refugees and Migrants, and the declaration that emerged from the meeting delays specific measures by UN member states for two more years. The timeline of the UN plan is not comforting to the refugees or concerned observers. The crisis figures are familiar, but remain unfathomable—one in 113 people displaced “by conflict and persecution in 2015;” and 54 percent of 21 million refugees from just three volatile countries: Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia. It’s easy to be numbed by the numbers. Or even actively repelled—across Europe and the United States, 2016 has seen a surge of anti-refugee protests and rhetoric conflatingrefugees and terrorists—sentiments that influence elections and produce significant legislative and societal results. In a sense, the refugee crisis has helped generate a corresponding crisis in empathy. But if national and international political solutions seem sluggish or even impossible, what hope is there for refugees in the meantime if not for the empathy of individuals? Where there is a confluence of human suffering and nationalistic backlash, can empathy be taught, sparked, or successfully deployed? The MSF exhibit can be seen as a test of these questions. It creates an empathetic response by tying the visitor’s experience to an individual’s—each participant is assigned a specific displaced person’s identity, and each tour is given by an aid-worker who has served in an MSF camp. Throughout the journey, the guides share their own personal stories about people they lived with, worked with, and ministered to, further illuminating the individual suffering behind the numbers. Abdalrazag, a physician with MSF originally from Iraq, first got involved with the organization when he was in a camp as a refugee. On his tours, he talks about a friend of his who, after living in a refugee camp tent for years, so desperately missed a wall to lean his back on that he hugged the first wall he saw in his new home. After the tour, Abdalrazag admitted that this was his own experience, one he sometimes obscures because his memories are painful to recount. Another guide, Sarah Khenati, a psychologist with MSF-France who has worked in the Central African Republic (CAR) and the West Bank, shares a story on her tours about a woman who was raped and impregnated while fleeing her home, then involves her groups in the ensuing MSF discussion about how best to treat the woman after her psychotic breakdown. Tatiana Chiarella, an MSF nurse from Brazil who has been touring with the exhibit, explained how she sees the value of these kinds of personal stories: “For people living in the U.S., or even my people in Brazil, we are so far from the situation that you may hear their stories but you don’t realize it could happen to any one of us.” The people she treated “were just like us, they were doctors, nurses, engineers, lawyers, and suddenly this happened—they have war in their countries and they have to flee for their life and for their families—and they lost everything.” Maybe it’s strange to shift the discussion of a massive problem down to the granular level, especially when the world needs a response to match the scale of the crisis. Yet individuals generate a human response that statistics can’t. Updated crisis figures from UNHCR don’t go viral. Images of a drowned Syrian toddler on a beach in Turkey, or a wounded boy in an Aleppo ambulance, do. And they focus observers, however briefly, on the human cost of conflict.   Still, the problem is bigger than the tragedies of Alan Kurdi and Omran Daqneesh, so the question remains whether concentrating on a single victim can generate an empathy that expands to include others suffering outside those particular frames. According to Jamil Zaki, assistant professor of psychology and the director of the Stanford Social Neuroscience Laboratory, even though empathy is a fundamental human emotion, people are not exactly wired for a globalized response. “When we evolved, we were in small groups of interdependent individuals, so the people that you would run into and subsequently empathize with were probably family or extended family,” he explained. “And nowadays, we’re given the unprecedented opportunity to empathize, reach out to and help, not just the people who are right around us, but people all around the world. That’s a really enormous challenge as well as an opportunity, and I think that sometimes, our more evolutionarily old or primitive … emotional responses are not really perfectly designed for the modern world.” This is even true of people who are already inclined to be sympathetic to refugees—the people, in other words, likely to visit an exhibit like MSF’s in the first place. On the tour I took, I met Cameron, a student from Charleston, South Carolina, who said: “It pains me to see how unaccepting communities can be of refugees especially when a good amount of people in the U.S. can trace their ancestry to people who left their home because of economic or political issues.” He added, “I think it definitely made me more empathetic and understanding because you only get so much information from the news and other media sources.” U.S. President Barack Obama, in his 2006 Northwestern University commencement speech, called attention to what he saw as a national “empathy deficit.” He advised the graduates that, in a culture that does not encourage empathy, “as you go on in life, cultivating this quality of empathy will become harder, not easier.  There’s no community-service requirement in the real world; no one forcing you to care. You’ll be free to live in neighborhoods with people who are exactly like yourself, and send your kids to the same schools, and narrow your concerns to what’s going in your own little circle.” That warning came 10 years ago; five years before the Syrian Civil War began, and eight years before UNHCR first identified a new record in the number of refugees worldwide. As David Desteno wrote for The Atlantic last summer, a recent study from the University of Michigan found, based on empathy assessments of 13,000 college students between 1979 and 2009, that “levels of compassion and empathy are lower now than at any time in the past 30 years, and perhaps most alarming, they are declining at an increasing rate.” If we think of empathy as malleable, it’s an emotion that we can actively choose to engage with and develop. The barrier that the MSF exhibit and other calls to empathy might bump up against is our basic wiring: If our relationship to empathy is naturally individual and impulsive—Zaki describes it as “staccato”—how do we create the sustained empathy suited to an ongoing and outsized crisis? Will the impact of an exhibit like Forced from Home—or photos of children whose lives have been ended or upended by war—be momentary or lasting? And what difference does any one person’s feelings make to finding a genuine solution? Some of the answers may lie in the way we think about empathy. If we think of it as malleable, it’s an emotion that we can actively choose to engage with and develop. Zaki emphasizes that empathy can be strengthened with practice: “Empathy is under our control more than we think it is. ... It’s our responsibility to exercise empathy responsibly, and it’s an opportunity for us to connect with more and more people if we work hard at building it.” Most importantly, Zaki says, “convincing people that they can build their empathy actually helps them to build [it].” He points to training programs that can change people’s responses to others’ suffering. A sampling of these empathy interventions across the country range from increasing care for homeless people in the Bay Area, to teaching empathy in middle schools to prevent bullying, to training police officers in Washington state to have compassion for citizens with mental illness so that they can be helped or hospitalized rather than arrested, though it’s too early to judge their effects. The refugee and the empathy crises can—but don’t have to—leave us with an action crisis. Even if MSF succeeds in generating empathy, the feeling by itself is not a solution. Still, it’s hard to see how there can be a solution without it.\n",

      "'This was a sad but avoidable tragedy'; kennel was warned about ventilation problems, trainer says —  Management and ownership at a Saskatoon dog kennel were warned about more than a dozen serious problems with their animal care methods in the months before this weekend’s death of 14 large breed dogs. “This was a sad but avoidable tragedy. I tried to prevent something like this,” said Fred Glawischnig, a certified master trainer and kennel care expert who said he presented his concerns to Playful Paws Pet Centre officials in January. The SPCA also received a copy of Glawischnig’s complaints, but SPCA executive director Patricia Cameron said the shelter is unable to pursue those types of allegations. Kennels are completely unregulated in Saskatchewan. “Under the law, we have no power to do that,” Cameron said. “If you are entrusting your animal to a facility, it’s up to the owner to investigate.” On Saturday morning, staff at Playful Paws Pet Centre in Sutherland walked in to an upper flow room to find 14 large breed dogs dead. The previous afternoon, an employee said the windowless room was getting uncomfortably hot as it has several times before. Before staff headed home for the evening, they were told to place fans in the room and close the door. The room did not cool. A malfunction in the building’s rooftop heating system caused it to get hotter and hotter. The dogs, which included Sarah Gee’s 10-month-old German Shepherd cross named Aurora, died of heat exhaustion. “She was a big, energetic dog. She was a big part of my life,” Gee said. “I’m disappointed no one was working overnight. That was my impression.” Carson Friesen, whose katahoula named Kali also died, expressed a similar concern. “I was under the impression they were under constant supervision,” he said. Kali was rescued from a shelter a year ago, and Friesen’s three-year-old daughter, Ella, loved taking care of her. Ella would feed and walk the dog, and prepare her bed every night. “That dog was her princess, her everything,” Friesen said. “We thought dropping (Kali) off there was a good thing to do. I regret that decision.” Playful Paws manager Bonnie Clark said she can’t imagine the pain of the affected owners. “It was severe. We are all just devastated,” said Playful Paws Pet Center manager Bonnie Clark Saturday. “We care about these animals.” Clark, whose eyes were filled with tears during a brief interview, said there was a “malfunction in the heating system.” The upper-floor room where the deaths occurred has been closed off. The business, however, will remain open, she said. When asked if there had been previous problems or concerns raised about the room or the facility, she said she had to get back to notifying owners. Clark said City of Saskatoon animal control officials have been notified. Clark said more information will likely be available in the coming days. “We have nothing to hide,” she said. A post on the Playful Paws Facebook page Saturday afternoon apologized to owners and explained the situation of the faulty heater. “I feel really, really bad. I’ve been crying all morning,” said an employee of Playful Paws who spoke on condition of anonymity. “They’re our customers’ dogs. They’re someone’s pet.” Playful Paws is a day and long-term care facility for dogs, cats and other animals. It also offers grooming and veterinary services. Many people who used the service posted this weekend on social media saying they were surprised because the service seemed good. Glawischnig said customers don’t see the full picture. In January 2016, Glawischnig accepted a job at Playful Paws. He said he was appalled by some of the conditions and practices. After three days, he made a list and had a meeting with management and ownership. Lack of fresh air and ventilation, especially in that room housing more than a dozen large breed dogs, was a chief concern. He said air should be exchanged completely several times an hour. “Heating and air movement – they’re some of the most important things in a kennel,” he said. “This is not just frustrating. It’s heartbreaking. I wish I could have done more.” Glawischnig said he quit when officials refused his suggestions. He took his list to the SPCA hoping an investigation would force reforms. Cameron said the SPCA and other groups are “often frustrated” by the limits of the legislation on the subject. There are no rules for kennels. The SPCA can only investigate cases of abuse, cruelty and other serious, imminent matters. The SPCA is part of a coalition urging the provincial Ministry of Agriculture to reform the legislation to better protect animals. “Hopefully, we’ll see some movement,” Cameron said. She extended her condolences to all of the owners, noting surveys which show 75 per cent of owners consider pet a member of the family. “This is all very heartbreaking. You just feel sick about it.”\n",

The SPCA is part of a coalition urging the provincial Ministry of Agriculture to reform the legislation to better protect animals. \"Hopefully, we'll see some movement,\" Cameron said. She extended her condolences to all of the owners, noting surveys which show 75 per cent of owners consider pet a member of the family. \"This is all very heartbreaking. You just feel sick about it.\"\n",

      "'Utter devastation' after major quake, aftershocks hit New Zealand —  A powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake pummeled central New Zealand early on Monday, killing at least two people, damaging roads and buildings and setting off hundreds of strong aftershocks.   Emergency response teams flew by helicopter to the region at the epicenter of the tremor, which struck just after midnight some 91 km (57 miles) northeast of Christchurch in the South Island, amid reports of injuries and collapsed buildings.   \"It's just utter devastation, I just don't know ... that's months of work,\" New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told Civil Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee after flying over the coastal town of Kaikoura, according to Brownlee's Twitter account. He described landslips in the area as \"just horrendous\". In a statement seen by Reuters, Key said of the likely damage bill: \"You’ve got to believe it’s in the billions of dollars to resolve.\"   Powerlines and telecommunications were down, with huge cracks in roads, land slips and other damage to infrastructure making it hard to reach the worst-affected areas.   A tsunami warning that led to mass evacuations after the original quake was downgraded after large swells hit New Zealand's capital Wellington, in the North Island, and Christchurch.   Wellington was a virtual ghost town with workers ordered to stay away while the city council assessed the risk to buildings, several of which were damaged by the tremor. There were concerns that loose glass and masonry could be dislodged by severe weather hitting the capital, with 140 km per hour (85 mph) winds forecast.   Hundreds of aftershocks, the strongest a 6.2 quake at about 1.45 p.m. local time (0045 GMT), rattled the South Pacific country, fraying nerves in an area where memories of a deadly 2011 quake are still fresh.   Christchurch, the largest city on New Zealand's ruggedly beautiful South Island, is still recovering from the 6.3 quake in 2011 that killed 185 people.   New Zealand's Civil Defence declared a state of emergency for the Kaikoura region, centered on a tourist town about 150 km (90 miles) northeast of Christchurch, soon after Monday's large aftershock.   Kaikoura, a popular spot for whale watching, appeared to have borne the brunt of the quake. \"Our immediate priority is ensuring delivery of clean water, food and other essentials to the residents of Kaikoura and the estimated 1,000 tourists in the town,\" Brownlee said.   The Navy's multi-role vessel HMNZS Canterbury was heading to the area, he said.   Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) said a 20-person rescue team and two sniffer dogs had arrived in the town. A second team was on standby in Christchurch, USAR said in a statement.   Police in the area around Christchurch reported 19 burglaries of homes and commercial properties after the quake as residents headed for higher ground.   \"It is extremely disappointing that at a time when people are facing such a traumatic event and communities are coming together to support one another, there are others who are only interested in taking advantage,” Canterbury District Commander Superintendent John Price said in a statement.   TWIN QUAKES   Hours after the quake, officials said a slip dam caused by the quakes that had blocked the Clarence River north of the town had breached, sending a wall of water downstream.   A group of kayakers missing on the river was later reported safe.   New Zealand's Geonet measured Monday's first quake at magnitude 7.5, while the U.S. Geological Survey put it at 7.8. The quakes and aftershocks rattled buildings and woke residents across the country, hundreds of kilometers from the epicenter.   Geonet said four faults had ruptured, with one at the coast appearing to have slipped as much as 10 meters (33 feet). Government research unit GNS Science said the overnight tremor appeared to have been two simultaneous quakes which together lasted more than two minutes.   New Zealand lies in the seismically active \"Ring of Fire\", a 40,000 km arc of volcanoes and oceanic trenches that partly encircles the Pacific Ocean. Around 90 percent of the world's earthquakes occur within this region.   Stock exchange operator NZX Ltd said markets traded normally, although many offices in the capital were closed. The New Zealand dollar initially fell to a one-month low before mostly recovering.   Fonterra, the world's biggest dairy exporter, said some its farms were without power and would likely have to dump milk.   Prime Minister Key postponed a trip to Argentina, where he had planned to hold a series of trade meetings ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders' summit in Peru this week, as he met disaster officials.   At least one of those killed was found in a house in Kaikoura that \"collapsed like a stack of cards\", Kaikoura Hospital's Dr Christopher Henry told Fairfax media. Two other people were pulled alive from the same building.   New Zealand media reported one of the pilots taking rescuers to the area was Richie McCaw, the recently retired captain of New Zealand's world champion All Blacks rugby team.   \"At one point, the railway was way out over the sea - it had been pushed out by (land) slips. It would not have been a nice place to be at midnight last night,\" McCaw told the New Zealand Herald after helping fly the USAR team to Kaikoura.\n",

      "1 Police Officer Dead, 1 Wounded After Western Pennsylvania Shooting —  One police officer was killed and another was wounded when they were “ambushed” while responding to a domestic dispute in western Pennsylvania, the authorities said on Thursday. Hours later, a man and a woman were found dead inside a home nearby.   A Pennsylvania state trooper, Melinda Bondarenka, told reporters that the officers from the Canonsburg police department had been responding to a domestic dispute around 3 a.m. on Thursday when they were “ambushed upon their arrival,” according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Little information was given as to the nature of the dispute, and the man and the woman found dead in the home were not identified.   The officer who was killed, Scott Leslie Bashioum, 52, was killed by a gun shot wound, according to the coroner’s report. He was pronounced dead shortly after 4 a.m. at Canonsburg Hospital. Dan Laurent, a spokesman for the Allegheny Health Network, said that the other officer who was shot was flown to Allegheny General Hospital, a nearby trauma center. There was no further word on his condition on Thursday.   The Associated Press reported that local schools in the town, about 20 miles southwest of Pittsburgh, were canceled while S.W.A.T. officers spent hours searching for the man who had opened fire on the officers. There were reports that the man found dead inside the home was the suspect, but they could not be immediately confirmed.   Gov. Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania said that he was in touch with the Pennsylvania state police and that he sent his “deepest condolences to the officer tragically killed.”   According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, at least 57 police officers have been killed by firearms so far in 2016, up from 35 in all of 2015. Last week, two police officers in Iowa were shot and killed when a man who had a history of confrontations with the police opened fire on their patrol cars.\n",

      "13 civilians killed by cross-border shelling in Kashmir, say India, Pakistan —  India and Pakistan say 13 civilians have been killed in cross-border shelling from both sides of the Line of Control, the de facto border between the two countries in the disputed region of Kashmir.   At least seven civilians on the Indian side of the Line of Control (LoC) were killed Tuesday and 15 others injured in shelling that came from the Pakistani side, according to local Indian authorities. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that six civilians on the Pakistani side had been killed by shelling from India Monday, and eight injured. Could India and Pakistan go to war? Women killed 'inside their homes' The casualties on the Pakistani side were in the Nikial and Jandrot areas, the statement said, adding that Pakistan's Director General had summoned India's Deputy High Chief Commissioner on Tuesday to strongly condemn the \"unprovoked ceasefire violations.\" Of the Indian casualties, five civilians were killed in heavy shelling in the Ramgrah sector of India's Samba district, Sheetal Nanda, Samba's district magistrate, told CNN. Nine others were injured in the area. Two women were also killed in shelling in the Manjakote area of Rajouri district, according to Johnny Williams, deputy inspector general of police in the district. \"The two ladies were inside their homes when shells landed there. They died on the spot,\" he said, adding that three others were injured in the strikes. Three civilians were also injured in India's Poonch district, police chief J.S. Johar told CNN. Neither side has responded to the allegations of ceasefire violations. The latest clashes come at a time of heightened tension between the neighbors over Kashmir, a Muslim-majority region that has been disputed territory between India and Pakistan for the past 70 years. Both of the nuclear-armed countries hold separate parts of the region and have fought two wars, in 1947 and 1965, over their claims. They came close to a third, in 1999. Tensions have flared since 19 Indian soldiers were killed in September in an attack by armed militants on an army base in Uri, about 63 miles (102 kilometers) from Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir. In the aftermath, India launched what it described as a \"surgical strike\" across the Line of Control to attack what it said was a terrorist launching pad. Pakistan denied that the target was a terrorist base, pointing out that two of its soldiers were killed. Amid the continuing fallout, India has relocated more than 10,000 people from around the disputed border area, and a top Bollywood director has refused to hire Pakistani actors.\n",

      "2 U.S. troops killed fighting Taliban in Afghanistan; civilians hit by airstrike —  KABUL — At least 26 Afghan civilians were killed and many others injured in airstrikes early Thursday while NATO and ­Afghan forces were battling ­Taliban fighters in northern Kunduz province, Afghan officials and witnesses said. Two American service members also died in ground clashes there, U.S. military officials confirmed. Details of the incidents were murky, with conflicting reports on the number of casualties and no official account of the airstrikes. Some local officials claimed that up to 100 civilians were killed or wounded in a series of airstrikes around Kunduz city. [NATO and government forces are increasingly responsible for Afghan civilian deaths] A portion of the strategic provincial capital was briefly overrun by insurgents last month, and Afghan troops assisted by U.S. forces have been trying to clear them from the area. The confusing and deadly ­drama recalled the tragic events in Kunduz just over a year ago, when the Taliban overran the city and Afghan and NATO forces were trying to beat them back. In the chaos, a U.S. airstrike mistakenly targeted an emergency hospital operated by Doctors Without Borders, killing 42 patients and staff members.  As of late Thursday, NATO officials had not confirmed or commented on the reported deaths of the civilians, who were said to be members of several families living in a neighborhood near the city. Photographs published on the Internet showed the bodies of small children crumpled on a blanket and being carried in a cart by weeping adults.  Angry relatives of the victims attempted to parade their bodies through the city to the provincial governor’s residence in a protest caravan, but they were stopped by security forces, Amruddin Wali, a member of the provincial council, said in a telephone interview.  A security official in Kunduz said an “operation against the opponents” resulted in the deaths of more than 20 civilians from “various families.” Ghulam Rabbani, another provincial council member, said 36 people were killed. Other officials said homes in various locations were destroyed by the strikes. [Kabul not spared Taliban strikes] U.S. military officials in Kabul confirmed that two U.S. service members were killed and two others wounded when they came under insurgent fire. “Despite today’s tragic event, we are steadfast in our commitment to help our Afghan partners defend their nation,” said Gen. John W. Nicholson, the senior U.S. military commander here, referring to the deaths of the U.S. troops.  Late Thursday afternoon, Brig. Gen. Charles Cleveland, the chief spokesman for Resolute Support, the U.S.-led NATO mission in Afghanistan, issued a statement that referred to airstrikes by “friendly forces” but did not confirm any civilian casualties. It said all information on that matter should come from Afghan officials. The NATO mission’s mandate is to assist, advise and train Afghan defense forces in their war against insurgents. Almost all foreign combat troops withdrew at the end of 2014, leaving Afghan troops facing an aggressive Taliban militia. “As part of an Afghan operation, friendly forces received direct fire and airstrikes were conducted to defend themselves,” Cleveland’s statement said. “We take all allegations of civilian casualties very seriously. As this was an Afghan operation, we’ll work with our partners to investigate but refer you to them for additional details in the near term. We’ll provide updates as we have them.” The senior Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman, Brig. Gen. Dawlat Waziri, said three Afghan special forces members were killed in fighting with the Taliban. He said he had no information on civilian deaths.  A spokesman for the Taliban, Zabiullah Mujahid, said three Taliban fighters were targeted by the Afghan and foreign forces and were then killed in a firefight in which Afghan and American troops also died. He said a large number of civilians also were killed. Pajhwok Afghan News quoted a farmer in Kunduz named Taza Gul as saying: “I was working on my farm when the bombardment started. On coming home, I saw seven members of my family, including women and children, killed in the raids.”  After the deadly 2015 airstrike in Kunduz, a U.S. military investigation led to the disciplining of 16 military members who were said to have made mistakes leading to the strike.

      "2 divers found dead in Florida cave system —  The signs tell divers the area is dangerous. Even experienced ones have died there.   Ten people, including two who were found Monday, have had fatal incidents inside the Eagle's Nest cave dive area in Western Florida since 1981. The Hernando County Sheriff's Office said Patrick Peacock and Chris Rittenmeyer went diving on Sunday afternoon with a third man, who reported the duo missing. Search and rescue divers found their bodies the next day in a \"very dangerous and complex area of the cave system,\" the sheriff's office said. Peacock and Rittenmeyer had come from Fort Lauderdale for a three-day dive at Eagle's Nest, a famous dive spot near Weeki Wachee, located in the Chassahowitzka Wildlife Management Area, about 60 miles north of Tampa. Both men were experienced divers who had both dived Eagle's Nest several times, the sheriff said. The third diver, Justin Blakeley, told authorities the three divers were supposed to meet at 3 p.m. Sunday, but Peacock and Rittenmeyer failed to show. Blakeley went back to the meeting spot every 30 minutes throughout the afternoon before calling police at 6 p.m. Becky Kagan Schott, an experienced cave diver and professional photographer who has dived Eagle's Nest about 20 times in her career, said the cave is a destination for many divers. \"Eagle's Nest is an alluring cave and many divers aspire to dive there someday,\" she said. \"It's like dropping down into a whole new world as you swim through giant passageways that have taken tens of thousands of years to form.\" Kagan Schott also cautioned that training and experience is paramount before attempting a dive at Eagle's Nest. \"Certified cave divers train hard so that when issues arise they have the muscle memory and experience to deal with them,\" Kagan Schott said. \"Even with that experience things can go wrong, but as cave divers we all know the risks before we go.\" According to Kagan Schott, 125 feet below the surface, near the area known to divers as the Debris Cone, is a permanently posted sign with an image of the Grim Reaper along with the stern warning, \"There's nothing in this cave worth dying for! Do not go beyond this point.\" The area was off limits for divers from 1999 to 2003, according to the St. Petersburg Times, which said the area had been compared with Mount Everest because it is beautiful but difficult. Diving expert Chuck Walls told CNN affiliate WFTS that only highly trained divers should attempt to dive there. He added that even skilled divers can be affected at dangerous depths. \"It's called martini's law for us old timers. For the new comer, it's nitrogen narcosis,\" Walls told the Tampa-based station. \"You have a lack of judgment and lose some of your inhibitions. Some people may even freeze up and do what we call 'white out.'\" Police have not said how the men died. The two divers were found more than 250 below the water's surface. Autopsy results have not been disclosed. Their deaths appear to be the first since a father and son died at the Eagle's Nest on Christmas 2013. According to CNN affiliate WFLA, they were trying out diving equipment they received as presents. WFTS reported some people have called for the area to be closed again while cave diving enthusiasts have said people know the risks and the site should be open for the people who have the training and experience.

      "2 divers found dead in Florida cave system — The signs tell divers the area is dangerous. Even experienced ones have died there. Ten people, including two who were found Monday, have had fatal incidents inside the Eagle's Nest cave dive area in Western Florida since 1981. The Hernando County Sheriff's Office said Patrick Peacock and Chris Rittenmeyer went diving on Sunday afternoon with a third man, who reported the duo missing. Search and rescue divers found their bodies the next day in a \"very dangerous and complex area of the cave system,\" the sheriff's office said. Peacock and Rittenmeyer had come from Fort Lauderdale for a three-day dive at Eagle's Nest, a famous dive spot near Weeki Wachee, located in the Chassahowitzka Wildlife Management Area, about 60 miles north of Tampa. Both men were experienced divers who had both dived Eagle's Nest several times, the sheriff said. The third diver, Justin Blakeley, told authorities the three divers were supposed to meet at 3 p.m. Sunday, but Peacock and Rittenmeyer failed to show. Blakeley went back to the meeting spot every 30 minutes throughout the afternoon before calling police at 6 p.m. Becky Kagan Schott, an experienced cave diver and professional photographer who has dived Eagle's Nest about 20 times in her career, said the cave is a destination for many divers. \"Eagle's Nest is an alluring cave and many divers aspire to dive there someday,\" she said. \"It's like dropping down into a whole new world as you swim through giant passageways that have taken tens of thousands of years to form.\" Kagan Schott also cautioned that training and experience is paramount before attempting a dive at Eagle's Nest. \"Certified cave divers train hard so that when issues arise they have the muscle memory and experience to deal with them,\" Kagan Schott said. \"Even with that experience things can go wrong, but as cave divers we all know the risks before we go.\" According to Kagan Schott, 125 feet below the surface, near the area known to divers as the Debris Cone, is a permanently posted sign with an image of the Grim Reaper along with the stern warning, \"There's nothing in this cave worth dying for! Do not go beyond this point.\" The area was off limits for divers from 1999 to 2003, according to the St. Petersburg Times, which said the area had been compared with Mount Everest because it is beautiful but difficult. Diving expert Chuck Walls told CNN affiliate WFTS that only highly trained divers should attempt to dive there. He added that even skilled divers can be affected at dangerous depths. \"It's called martini's law for us old timers. For the new comer, it's nitrogen narcosis,\" Walls told the Tampa-based station. \"You have a lack of judgment and lose some of your inhibitions. Some people may even freeze up and do what we call 'white out.'\" Police have not said how the men died. The two divers were found more than 250 below the water's surface. Autopsy results have not been disclosed. Their deaths appear to be the first since a father and son died at the Eagle's Nest on Christmas 2013. According to CNN affiliate WFLA, they were trying out diving equipment they received as presents. WFTS reported some people have called for the area to be closed again while cave diving enthusiasts have said people know the risks and the site should be open for the people who have the training and experience. When CNN inquired with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, asking whether the site might be closed, spokeswoman Susan Smith didn't comment. She offered the department's sympathies to the relatives of the two divers. \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to these families,\" she wrote in an email.\n",

      "20 Iconic Moments In Women's Sport That Made Everyone Cheer —  Over the years there has been a greater level of interest in women's sport and that's partly down to the athletes themselves, who, as we will soon profile, have overcome various obstacles and challenges to get to where they are today. Think Maria Sharapova, who, in recent years has become one of the highest-paid athletes in the world having emigrated to America with her dad aged only 7. Or the Italian diver Tania Cagnotto, whose signature good looks have given her fame beyond her wildest dreams. Yes, female athletes are all the rage at the moment and as well as gracing us with their athletic abilities many have made millions from various endorsements, including high-profile modelling gigs.  With that in mind, here are 20 iconic female athletes, many of whom were involved in some of sports' most iconic moments. 1. Ronda Rousey Before a loud-mouthed Irishman by the name of Connor McGreogor came onto the scene, the face of UFC was arguably that of the famed and fearless female fighter, Ronda Rousey. The American, who in 2015 was the third most searched name on Google, started her mixed-martial-arts career as a judo fighter and won bronze at the 2008 Bejing Olympics before eventually transitioning to cage fighting. After making her UFC bow in 2012, Ronda Rousey went 11 matches undefeated, with each of her wins coming in the first round before she suffered a surprising defeat to underdog Holly Holm.  Since her fame, Ronda has also appeared in many movies, with a notable role coming in the much-criticised Entourage movie. Aside from Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, Rousey is female sport's most famous name. 2. Maria Sharapova For a sport that has done many things to further the prominence female athletes, in only right we feature another one of its stars. Maria Sharapova, born in Russia but raised in Florida, became one of the youngest Grand Slam winners in history when she beat Serena Williams in the 2004 Wimbledon final, aged just 17. What it spawned for Maria and female tennis was a multitude of attention. In fact, along with the Williams sisters, female tennis became one of the most watched sports in the world, and part of the attraction came from Maria's widespread appeal and by the mid 00's, the Russian ace and four-time slam winner was topping every athlete rich list imaginable. As of today, the 29-year-old remains the wealthiest female athlete of all time, which is iconic in the sense that until very recently, female athletes, no matter how talented they were, were only being paid a fraction of what was on offer in the male game. 3. The Williams Sisters Sisters and all-round megastars Venus and Serena Williams changed female tennis in ways perhaps only the legendary Billy Jean King has surpassed the moment they first came onto the scene in the late 1990s. Potent forces in both doubles and singles, the world, has become accustomed to seeing their opponents blown away by their macho-like aggression and breathtaking athleticism which has led the sisters to win almost every title out there. But the feared duo is as much a force in tennis as they are in the women's game, and in recent years, Serena's domination and hogging of the number 1 ranking have seen her become of one the highest-earning athletes in the world, surpassed by only a handful of males. 4. Gretchen Bleiler Before Gretchen Bleiler came onto the scene, female participation in snowboarding largely consisted of pretty women holding up placards before the men did their thing. Thankfully Gretchen Bleiler changed that when she became the first to land the death-defying \"crippler 540\" in competition and would go on to become one of the sport's most celebrated athletes, winning gold at four consecutive Aspen games as well as silver in the Halfpipe competition at 2006's Winter Olympics.  The American's remarkable medal, coupled with her Hollywood looks has garnered the athlete an impressive 133k Twitter followers, and many have since credited her with elevating her sport into a more mainstream audience.  5. Dara Torress  If Michael Phelps is the king of the pool, then Dara Torress can surely make a case for being its queen. As well qualifying and then competing in five Olympic games (1984, 1988, 1992, 2000 and 2008), she's also collected medals in all five of them. Being one of only two Americans to achieve such a feat- the other being the skeet shooter Kim Rhode- Torres' current Olympic medal collection stands at 12 and is also a former world record holder in three events. 6. Simone Biles As the most decorated American gymnast, Biles attracts attention from all of America's major media outlets whenever she performs, and such an interest in her talent was richly rewarded when she mesmerised the judges and indeed the many millions at home watching when performing at the Rio Olympics. In total, her medal haul amounted to an incredible four golds, which came in the individual all-around, vault,  floor and team competition. Unsurprisingly, Biles' spellbinding displays, most notably in day one of the Olympic trials, made her an overnight sensation, with many magazines and newspapers believing Biles can one day match her fellow compatriot Serena Williams in career earnings. But Biles would likely have taken more heart from an article written by The Guardian's Bryan Armen, who labelled the 4ft 8in Biles 'the best athlete in America.'  7. Billie Jean King Billie Jean King was a major pioneer in women's sport ever since the 39-time Grand Slam winner set up and won the infamous 1973 'battle of the sexes' match against the notoriously pugnacious tennis player, Bobby Riggs. Watched by a global television audience of over 100m people, King went on to beat Riggs in straight sets, and many have since viewed the match as a watershed in not only the game of tennis but the whole of women's sport. By 2007, for instance, grand slam prize money in tennis was the same for both men and women while other sports where female participation is prevalent have strived for similar equality, with many governing boards asking for King's advice on how best they can further the careers of their female stars. 8. Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh The dynamic and fearsome American duo have long been considered the greatest volleyball team of all time, a reputation that has only been cemented over the years following consecutive gold medals at the last three Olympics and World Championships. The pair first came to prominence when they ran rings around every opponent at the 2008 Olympics, which would see them take the gold without losing a single set. After 2012's triumph, the celebrated duo decided to part ways after Misty-May's decision to retire.  Kerri Welsh would go on to compete with new partner April Ross at the Rio Games, although the two ended up losing in the semi-final. 9. Katherine Schweitzer After Katherine Switzer's coach had warned her that she was too 'fragile' to run a full-length marathon, Switzer thought better and became the first woman to compete in the Boston Marathon when she defied the all-male criteria. However, in 1967, the time the incident took place, women were barred from competing and the race organiser Jock Semple chased her down once he noticed what Switzer was doing. But it was the heroics of her boyfriend and the other male runners who won over the world with their actions, as they stopped Semple from reaching her. It wouldn't be until 1972 that women were allowed to compete.  10. Tania Cagnotto Tania Cagnotto first made waves in Italy as a talented 15-year-old diver when she qualified for the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. Despite only finishing 18th, the Italian star would go on to win a gold medal at the 2015 FINA world championships, becoming the first Italian to do so. Now retired after winning silver and bronze at the 2016 Olympics, the 31-year-old has been a major celebrity in her homeland for some time.  In fact, after doing a raunchy shoot for Playboy Italy in 2013, the crowd in attendance at one of her competitions cheered after a disappointing dive shortly after the photos were released, but she couldn't understand why. 11. Hope Solo Being a goalkeeper in the world of soccer often means a lot of criticism and not much praise, but female goalie Hope Solo proved that isn't always the case. Instead, the American shot-stopper would go on to become one of the most decorated female athletes, a feat that was achieved when she made a string of match-winning performances in the 2008 Olympics and ultimately helping her team take gold. And the same was true in London four years later. The US team, with captain Solo at the helm, would take another gold at the 2012 Olympics, and further cement the U.S. as the best team in women's soccer. Now retired, Hope can hold her head high having amassed a plethora of international records including most appearances (202), starts (190), wins (153) and shutouts (102).  12. At the London 2012 Olympics, Every Country Had Female Athletes Representing Them When female athletes from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the Islamic Sultanate of Brunei were first allowed to compete at the Olympic Games in 2012, it proved a turning point in women's sport. For the first time in Olympic history, every country had female athletes on their roster, and many viewed it at as the final step in eradicating gender inequality in sport. Admittedly, the Saudi female athletes were forced to have a male guardian accompanying them as well as wear a \"Sharia-compliant\" sports kit that covered their hair, but it no doubt proved a start of better things to come. 13. Danica Patrick Winning In the dangerous and often high-octane world of high-speed racing, sports like Formula 1, NASCAR, and INDYCAR have long been viewed as a macho sport dominated by courageous men, so when Danica Patrick became one of only a select of women to compete in American-open-wheel-racing, many heads were turned. Indeed, while Danica's gender was a main point of interest, it was her winning exploits on the track that turned someone first known as a professional female driver into a sporting sensation when she finished first in the Japan Indy. The famous victory meant that she became the first (and only) woman to win an IndyCar Series race and if that wasn't impressive enough, she took third place in the Indianapolis 500 the following year. Danica has also forged a successful career for herself in the NASCAR Spring Cup Series, and famously finished 8th in the Daytona 500, the highest ever for a female driver.  14. Flo Jo The late Florence Griffith-Joyner was arguably the female equivalent of Usain Bolt during the1980s because every time she ran another record as almost guaranteed to be broken.  Also sharing a similar charisma to the Jamaican, Flo Jo, as she was endearingly nicknamed, was also someone who thrived off pressure and the limelight that came with it and famously accepted her 1988 Olympic medals sporting her trademark elongated fingernails. Her career reached its peak after the success of her record-breaking exploits at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, in which she won three medals. The victories would come with world records in both the 100m and 200m.  Her times of 10.49 seconds in the 100m and 21.34 in the 200m are yet to be broken.  15. Mo'ne Davis Mo'ne Davis became the first African-American female to play in baseball's Little League Wolrd Series and was also the first girl to pitch a winning game when she pitched an impressive 70-mile-per-hour fastball. Due to the significance of her achievement, Davis attracted national attention and even landed on the cover of Sports Illustrated. The magazine identified her as \"Sports Kid of the Year\" and at only 15-years-old, Mo'ne has already done much to convince girls her age that taking part in sport shouldn't be seen as a bad thing. 16. Becky Hammon Becky Hammon enjoyed a successful career in America's premier female basketball league but is more known for being the first full-time assistant coach when The San Antonio Spurs sought her services. Many have since viewed Hammon's appointment as a precedent for future female employment within men's sport. 17. Diana Nyad Swimming long distances isn't for the fainthearted and one person who knows that all too well is Diana Nyad, who became the first person to swim from Cuba to Florida without the aid of a shark cage. The 2013 achievement, which was 35 years in the making having unsuccessfully tried on five separate occasions, marked another significant moment in women's sport. As well as Nyad's record, the 63-year-old was praised for her persistence, with hypothermia, violent storms, stinging jellyfish and the likely possibility of being eaten by sharks all getting in her way on the other five occasions.  18. Molly Huddle As one of the world's premier marathons, New York City's marathon (and half-marathon) attracts thousands of entrants. In 2016, Olympic long-distance runner Huddle competed in the women's half-marathon. But not only did she show up or even run a respectable time- she won with a time of 1.07.41. If Molly were seven seconds faster with her finish, she would have broken the female half-marathon American record set by Dena Kastor, who won the 2006 Berlin Half Marathon with a time of 1.07.34 19. Kelly Kulick Many may sniff their noses at the assertion that bowling is a sport, let alone one that is played professionally, but that shouldn't take away the achievements of Kelly Kulick who has dominated in a game mostly seen as the preserve of kids and middle-aged men. 20. Nadia Comăneci The last person on this list is someone whose contribution to the female sporting world will forever be remembered At only 14, the Romanian gymnast scored a perfect 10 from the judges for her performance on the uneven bars and was the first perfect score in the sports' history. Now 54, the former athlete has twice been presented with the Olympic Order, which aims to reward those for distinguished commitments to the Olympic movement.\n",

      "28 Days in Chains —  In this federal prison, inmates have a choice: live with a violent cellmate or end up in shackles.          On Feb. 3, 2011, corrections officers at Lewisburg federal penitentiary in rural Pennsylvania arrived outside Sebastian Richardson’s cell door. With them was a man looking agitated and rocking back and forth. He stared down at Richardson, who at 4 feet, 11 inches was nicknamed “Bam Bam.”  The man, officers told Richardson, was his new cellmate. The two would spend nearly 24 hours a day celled together in a concrete room smaller than a parking space. Richardson, 51, didn’t know his new cellmate’s name, only that he also went by a nickname: \"The Prophet.\" He had a habit of screaming songs or shouting the spelling of words for hours, as though competing in his own private spelling bee. There were also rumors that he had assaulted more than 20 previous “cellies.” “He’s Lewisburg’s weapon,” said former Lewisburg inmate Deangelo Moore. “If he like you, he like you. But if he don’t, he’s your worst enemy.” “Every cellie he get he always end up fighting,” said Lenelle Gray, another former Lewisburg inmate. “He was just crazy.” So when officers told Richardson to cuff up and step aside to make room for his new cellmate, he refused. Richardson later claimed in a lawsuit1 that the guards took The Prophet away and then returned 30 minutes later with reinforcements. They moved him to a laundry area to be stripped, searched, and put in paper clothes. Richardson yelped in pain as they then placed him in hand and ankle cuffs, clicking them tighter until they cut into his wrists and Achilles tendon. A chain, locked high on his chest in a practice known among staff as “T-rexing,” forced his arms into an awkwardly high bend and made it hard to breathe. Officers then walked him, haltingly, to a cell where another man was being held in identical shackles. lawsuit 1 The details of Richardson's story are laid out in a lawsuit he filed against the Bureau of Prisons and the agency's response to that lawsuit — and are reinforced by Richardson's letters from prison and interviews with former inmates. According to inmates' lawyers, Lewisburg staffers, and more than 40 current and former prisoners — who made similar claims in lawsuits, court testimonies, government audits, or letters and interviews with The Marshall Project and NPR — restraints are used as punishment at Lewisburg, often for those who refuse their cell assignments. Inmates have no say over who shares their cell, even if guards place them with someone who has a violent history, is from a rival gang, or is suffering from a severe mental illness. If they try to refuse a cellmate out of fear, as Richardson said he did, they are locked into metal “ambulatory restraints” for hours or days until they relent. Seven prisoners said that they were threatened with or subjected to a punishment far more painful than ambulatory restraints, a form of punishment that at other prisons is used as a short-term last resort for uncontrollable inmates. It is known as “four-pointing” and consists of having each limb cuffed to a corner of a concrete slab or bed frame. Richardson was freezing in the new cell. He claimed that guards left the window open when they locked him in. His paper uniform was no match for the Pennsylvania winter air. It didn’t help that the uniform was soaked with urine; in restraints, he wasn’t able to pull his pants down to use the toilet. Richardson’s cuffs also made the top bunk an impossible reach. So when the other prisoner would take the bottom bed, Richardson did the only thing he could: He would curl up on the concrete floor. Guards came every two hours to check on him. Richardson said they ignored his complaints: his swelling hands, his soiled clothes, his cut ankles. Instead they reiterated his options — be locked in a tiny cell with a violent man or cope with the restraints. Richardson remained cuffed for 28 days. The Special Management Unit where Richardson was housed was created in 2009 for “dangerously violent, confrontational, defiant, antagonistic inmates,” according to the federal Bureau of Prisons. Richardson, serving a 35-year sentence for drug trafficking, was transferred there in March 2010 for assaulting a corrections officer; in his telling, he was intervening in a fight between a guard and another inmate. The aim of the SMU is to increase safety at other federal prisons by culling their most problematic inmates and putting them through a three-step rehabilitation program (if an inmate breaks a rule or gets into a fight, he may have to repeat a step). Prisoners are assigned a series of workbooks and journal entries to be completed in-cell on topics like “The Con Game,” the “criminal lifestyle,” and anger management. BOP lectures play over inmates’ radios, instructing them on everything from diversity to parenting. At Lewisburg, the vast majority of those inmates are in “double-cell” solitary, housed with another prisoner in cells as small as 6 feet by 10 feet for nearly 24 hours a day. The cells were originally built for just one person, but officials doubled up the SMU inmates in order to teach them to “successfully coexist,” according to the prisoner handbook. It also helped alleviate overcrowding — high-security federal prisons are overstuffed by more than 50 percent. As a result, prisoners in the SMU share excessively tight cells; between the bunks, sink, toilet, desk, and the roommate, there is barely room to stand. “When I use the toilet, his feet are on my knees,” said Moore, the former Lewisburg inmate. Inmates get a brief reprieve from the closetlike conditions every week for medical care, three showers, and five hours in a “recreation cage.” Double-cell solitary is a common practice in federal prisons, where more than 80 percent of the nearly 11,000 inmates in restricted housing have a cellmate. But Lewisburg has the added danger of housing some of the bureau’s most volatile prisoners. “I’ve gone to as many as three, four cell fights in a day, a lot more than you would at any other institution,” said a current SMU corrections officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing his job. Guards in SWAT gear are often seen running down the tier with pepper balls and handcuffs to break up brawling cellmates, including the prisoner who was found kicking a roommate lying in the fetal position, the prisoner who tore off half of his cellmate's ear, and the inmate who slashed his cellmate with a razor blade. According to incident reports obtained by The Marshall Project and NPR, officers responded to 228 in-cell fights and assaults with restraints or pepper spray in 2014 and 2015. At least 19 inmates were treated for injuries such as a collapsed lung, a broken rib, multiple stab wounds, and head injuries. Since the SMU opened, there have been more than 800 recorded inmate-on-inmate assaults — a rate six times higher than all federal prisons. And in that time, at least four inmates have been killed by their cellmates. In August, the Bureau of Prisons announced changes to the SMU in response to recommendations made by the Department of Justice. The new policy limited the length of the rehabilitation program to 12 months and ensured that prisoners who failed to advance on schedule cannot be held in the SMU for longer than two years. Prisoners are also supposed to receive more thorough mental health screenings before and during their time in the unit. But the conditions that inmates are held in, and the practice of using restraints against them, remain unchanged. At other facilities, if an inmate objects to his cellmate out of concern for his safety, he may be given a disciplinary notice for disobeying orders, be held in a cell by himself while officers investigate his complaints, or be ignored altogether. Restraints of any kind are meant to be used briefly and as a last alternative. “The inmate who refuses to cell with someone ordinarily receives an incident report for ‘Refusing A Program Assignment,’ which is a moderate severity infraction,” wrote Jack T. Donson, a former Bureau of Prisons official and current correctional consultant, in an email. “Restraints should not be applied simply because they refuse a cellmate.” The procedures in the SMU leave inmates with few, difficult options: They can verbally refuse their cellmate and risk being restrained. Or they can live with someone they fear, risking attack. Some resort to throwing the first punch, in plain view of guards, knowing that the officers will have to separate them — a strategy that often lands them in restraints, too. Incident reports show that at least 48 men attacked their cellmate directly in front of officers in 2014 and 2015. “I’ve been practicing for almost 30 years, and my clients tell me Lewisburg is the worst place they’ve ever been,” said assistant federal public defender D. Toni Byrd, who has represented several Lewisburg defendants and sits on the board of the Lewisburg Prison Project, a prisoners’ rights nonprofit. “If you did to your dog what they do to men here, you would be arrested.” The BOP declined multiple interview requests for this story. In response to detailed questions about The Marshall Project and NPR’s findings, spokesman Justin Long said he could not comment on pending lawsuits. “The Bureau ensures inmates in its custody are treated fairly and with dignity,” Long wrote in an email. “Allegations of mistreatment are thoroughly investigated and appropriate action is taken if such allegations are proven true.” Long noted that the SMUs are “non-punitive” units meant for inmates with a history of violence. In February 2014, former Lewisburg inmate Royce Brown, who was sentenced to 20 years on drug and gun possession charges, said he had been housed with a “gunner” — someone who masturbates when a woman walks down the tier. During the 18 days they lived together, tension and frustration mounted. “We were stuck looking at each other waiting for it to pop,” Brown said. “It was torture just being in the cell with him.” Brown said that one morning, his cellmate told him, “We can’t live in the cell together no more. I’m gonna make ‘em gas us.” Brown asked to be moved, but guards ignored his requests. Brown knew the protocol: If he attacked his cellmate in front of corrections officers, they would be forced to remove him. “I [hit] him a few times and I put him on the ground,” Brown said. “Now they have to separate us.” Surveillance footage shows more than 30 officers ran down the tier as some shot pepper spray and pepper balls into Brown’s cell to break up the fight. Brown stuck his hands out of the slot to be cuffed and was removed by guards wearing gas masks and blue and black sweatshirts that read “The Big House.” “I tried to deal with this the right way,” Brown told an officer as staff bound his limbs, tears and mucus dripping from his face. “Lieutenant, I tried to get you to talk to me.” As guards chained his hands, ankles, and chest, Brown yelled out in pain. “God damn these are tight. I can’t even breathe.” Brown remained restrained for more than 24 hours after hitting his cellmate, one of several times he was shackled at Lewisburg. A year and a half after coming home, he still has scars on his wrists and stomach. The Lewisburg Prison Project, which has a two-person staff, received 962 letters from Lewisburg prisoners in 2015 and makes regular visits to the penitentiary. They often hear the same complaint. “You are placed in a cell with shackles so tight, I’ve seen probably 30 guys at Lewisburg months later who have open wounds,” said Dave Sprout, a paralegal at the project who is in charge of inmate visits and correspondence. “Many guys can’t eat, they can’t use the bathroom.” At least two men have filed lawsuits alleging that they were forced to drink from the toilet when they could not operate the sink in their restraints. Another Lewisburg inmate filed a lawsuit claiming that the ambulatory restraints were so tight he passed out and still suffers from nerve damage in his hands. He was restrained, he said, for trying to avoid a dangerous cell assignment. A 2014 independent audit of solitary in federal prisons, commissioned by the Bureau of Prisons, noted that a “significant percentage” of Lewisburg inmates they interviewed complained about the overuse and harsh application of restraints. “The high number of reported incidents … suggests the need for further investigation,” auditors wrote. In their response, BOP officials did not comment on that aspect of the audit. Then in November 2015, the D.C. Corrections Information Council, a city government agency that inspects facilities where Washington, D.C. prisoners are housed (the district has no prisons of its own), concluded that the SMU was in violation of federal use-of-force policies. Seventeen D.C. inmates said officers abused restraints, with several recounting how they had been held for days at a time in chains that caused nerve damage in their hands and feet. One prisoner showed investigators his scars and said his three days in restraints was “the most agonizing experience of my life.” Another told investigators that he was held in restraints for refusing a cellmate, and was “forced to defecate and urinate in his pants because the restraints were so tight he could not remove [the pants].” The Bureau of Prisons said in a statement that all of the allegations were investigated, and none were substantiated. But some staffers don’t deny that the prison relies on restraints. “If you allow inmates to dictate the terms under which they get a cellie, then you’re not in control,” the Lewisburg guard said. “[Officers] don’t think twice about putting someone in restraints if they’re insubordinate or if they’re not being compliant with the rules,” said Marc Marchioli, who worked as a physician assistant at Lewisburg from October 2012 to May 2014. “You have to remember these guys are dangerous people. If they don’t cuff up, it’s considered a direct threat.” Marchioli said that officers applied restraints correctly — but that inmates caused their own injuries when they tried to move. “The more they wiggle, the more damage they end up doing.” Last year was a particularly violent one at Lewisburg. In August 2015, Jimmy Barker, serving a 13-year sentence for fraud, died after a fight with his cellmate. BOP documents obtained by The Marshall Project and NPR show that Barker had been in a psychiatric hospital three times and attempted suicide twice, but that a Lewisburg psychologist found no evidence of serious mental illness before placing him in a double cell with another inmate. Then in October, Gerardo Arche-Felix was killed by his cellmate. Arche-Felix, 57, was serving a five-year sentence for attempted entry after deportation and had been at Lewisburg since April 2014. He had tried to cross the border in 2012 to rejoin his family in Utah after being sent to Mexico two years earlier. He was also a diagnosed schizophrenic and said he had not been given his medication for much of his time in Lewisburg. Prison documents show that psychology staff in the SMU repeatedly found Arche-Felix to have “no significant mental health issues,” though he had previously been under an involuntary treatment order in a Utah state prison and was forced to take antipsychotic drugs. Without medication, Arche-Felix could be erratic, agitated, and paranoid. “It’s been more than a month I don’t take my meds,” he wrote in a letter to his daughter, Jana Oman, in September 2014. “I need my meds or I’ll lose my mind.” “It was hell. You could hear it in his voice every time he spoke on the phone or read a letter,” Oman said. “Little by little, he was just falling apart.” Because of his mental health problems and slight, 5-foot-8-inch frame, Arche-Felix was especially vulnerable to attacks from other prisoners. “My cellmate went crazy on me and started to beat me up while I was asleep. He is younger and taller and stronger than me,” he wrote in November 2014. He often ended up in restraints, according to his family, for his erratic behavior. “He told my aunt that he would be handcuffed on his ankles and around his wrists and they would be chained together,” Oman said. “He’d be like that for days.” Arche-Felix’s sister, Kiana Arche, said her brother grew more afraid the longer he spent in the SMU. At Lewisburg, his options were to accept the cellmates he desperately feared or end up shackled in a cell. One day he called his sister and told her, “‘Call this nurse and please tell her they need to move me from here,’” she recounted. “‘This not right. I’m so scared. I’m not supposed to be here.’” Oman received a call the morning of October 14, 2015, from the prison chaplain, who told her that her father was dead. Days later, she read in the newspaper that his death was a suspected homicide. Prosecutors have since confirmed they are investigating his cellmate for murder. On Arche-Felix's death certificate, his cause of death reads \"strangulation by ligature.\" After seven days in restraints, Sebastian Richardson remained determined. He would not be put in the same small cell with The Prophet or any other violent prisoner. So officers tried something else. A team of guards took Richardson to a room, painted floor to ceiling in pink, a shade designed to soothe aggressive behavior. In the center of the room was a bed frame topped with a thin pad. As is protocol, guards laid Richardson on the bed and bound each limb to one of its corners. Because he was so short, the restraints were even more painful because his arms and legs had to stretch farther to reach each post. Officers then draped a paper blanket over him before leaving the room and locking the door. He was left to stay in the pink room, splayed and immobile. Richardson screamed out in pain as he was being chained down. He claimed one officer again opened the window before leaving the room, as other prisoners have accused guards of doing. His requests for water and a bathroom break were ignored, leaving him shivering in his soiled paper uniform. The Bureau of Prisons confirmed that Richardson was four-pointed but denied his description of the conditions. They claimed he was placed in more severe restraints for threatening to assault staff. Richardson was pinned down for a total of eight hours. He was then put back into ambulatory restraints for three more weeks. He said he was uncuffed only once, to take a shower. “They placed the restraints on me so tight ... my hands had puffed up. Each finger looked like the Valasic [sic] pickles ... not the smaller ones, the medium size,” he later wrote to Dave Sprout of the Lewisburg Prison Project about restraints at Lewisburg. “My wrists were so swollen the cuffs were stuck in them.” On March 2, 2011, almost a month after he’d been cuffed, Richardson agreed to live with any cellmate they gave him. At one point, he was housed with someone he said had not been given his psychiatric medication. The inmate stayed up all night talking to himself. After that cellmate was moved, Richardson claimed that officers tried to get him to live with someone who had stabbed him on the rec yard of another facility. Richardson refused and ended up in restraints again. This time, he was held in shackles for 16 days, one of which was spent four-pointed. Richardson claimed this cycle continued several more times during his two-and-a-half years in the SMU. “It is my desire to get through this violating, unstable, dangerous environment, but not at the cost of jeopardizing my safety and life,” Richardson wrote in a letter to Sprout. “[They] said they will keep putting me in 4-points until I go where they put me.” In December 2011, the Lewisburg Prison Project and the Pennsylvania Institutional Law Project, a legal aid organization, filed a federal lawsuit over the prison’s use of restraints, with Sebastian Richardson as the lead plaintiff. The case is ongoing. In response to the suit, Bureau of Prisons officials denied that Lewisburg staff are placing inmates in restraints as punishment. The bureau also objected to the claim that restraints are applied in a way that injures or prevents prisoners from eating, drinking, or using the toilet. “Inmates in ambulatory restraints are able to take care of basic human needs without staff intervention,” they wrote. A kind of relief came to Richardson in September 2012, when he was transferred out of Lewisburg to the supermax prison in Florence, Colo., the highest-security prison in the country. There, inmates are locked down in a single cell for almost 24 hours a day. Though Florence has been called “America’s Toughest Prison,” for many in Lewisburg’s SMU, it’s seen as an escape. At Florence, they can live alone, free from the constant threat of violence. As Richardson wrote in a letter to Sprout, “anywhere is a better place to be.”\n",
      "AFTER CLEANING:\n",
      "28 Days in Chains — In this federal prison, inmates have a choice: live with a violent cellmate or end up in shackles. On Feb. 3, 2011, corrections officers at Lewisburg federal penitentiary in rural Pennsylvania arrived outside Sebastian Richardson's cell door. With them was a man looking agitated and rocking back and forth.

Prison documents show that psychology staff in the SMU repeatedly found Arche-Felix to have \"no significant mental health issues,\" though he had previously been under an involuntary treatment order in a Utah state prison and was forced to take antipsychotic drugs. Without medication, Arche-Felix could be erratic, agitated, and paranoid. \"It's been more than a month I don't take my meds,\" he wrote in a letter to his daughter, Jana Oman, in September 2014. \"I need my meds or I'll lose my mind.\" \"It was hell. You could hear it in his voice every time he spoke on the phone or read a letter,\" Oman said. \"Little by little, he was just falling apart.\" Because of his mental health problems and slight, 5-foot-8-inch frame, Arche-Felix was especially vulnerable to attacks from other prisoners. \"My cellmate went crazy on me and started to beat me up while I was asleep. He is younger and taller and stronger than me,\" he wrote in November 2014. He often ended up in restraints, according to his family, for his erratic behavior. \"He told my aunt that he would be handcuffed on his ankles and around his wrists and they would be chained together,\" Oman said. \"He'd be like that for days.\" Arche-Felix's sister, Kiana Arche, said her brother grew more afraid the longer he spent in the SMU. At Lewisburg, his options were to accept the cellmates he desperately feared or end up shackled in a cell. One day he called his sister and told her, \"'Call this nurse and please tell her they need to move me from here,'\" she recounted. \"'This not right. I'm so scared. I'm not supposed to be here.'\" Oman received a call the morning of October 14, 2015, from the prison chaplain, who told her that her father was dead. Days later, she read in the newspaper that his death was a suspected homicide. Prosecutors have since confirmed they are investigating his cellmate for murder. On Arche-Felix's death certificate, his cause of death reads \"strangulation by ligature.\" After seven days in restraints, Sebastian Richardson remained determined. He would not be put in the same small cell with The Prophet or any other violent prisoner. So officers tried something else. A team of guards took Richardson to a room, painted floor to ceiling in pink, a shade designed to soothe aggressive behavior. In the center of the room was a bed frame topped with a thin pad. As is protocol, guards laid Richardson on the bed and bound each limb to one of its corners. Because he was so short, the restraints were even more painful because his arms and legs had to stretch farther to reach each post. Officers then draped a paper blanket over him before leaving the room and locking the door. He was left to stay in the pink room, splayed and immobile. Richardson screamed out in pain as he was being chained down. He claimed one officer again opened the window before leaving the room, as other prisoners have accused guards of doing. His requests for water and a bathroom break were ignored, leaving him shivering in his soiled paper uniform. The Bureau of Prisons confirmed that Richardson was four-pointed but denied his description of the conditions. They claimed he was placed in more severe restraints for threatening to assault staff. Richardson was pinned down for a total of eight hours. He was then put back into ambulatory restraints for three more weeks. He said he was uncuffed only once, to take a shower. \"They placed the restraints on me so tight ... my hands had puffed up. Each finger looked like the Valasic [sic] pickles ... not the smaller ones, the medium size,\" he later wrote to Dave Sprout of the Lewisburg Prison Project about restraints at Lewisburg. \"My wrists were so swollen the cuffs were stuck in them.\" On March 2, 2011, almost a month after he'd been cuffed, Richardson agreed to live with any cellmate they gave him. At one point, he was housed with someone he said had not been given his psychiatric medication. The inmate stayed up all night talking to himself. After that cellmate was moved, Richardson claimed that officers tried to get him to live with someone who had stabbed him on the rec yard of another facility. Richardson refused and ended up in restraints again. This time, he was held in shackles for 16 days, one of which was spent four-pointed. Richardson claimed this cycle continued several more times during his two-and-a-half years in the SMU. \"It is my desire to get through this violating, unstable, dangerous environment, but not at the cost of jeopardizing my safety and life,\" Richardson wrote in a letter to Sprout. \"[They] said they will keep putting me in 4-points until I go where they put me.\" In December 2011, the Lewisburg Prison Project and the Pennsylvania Institutional Law Project, a legal aid organization, filed a federal lawsuit over the prison's use of restraints, with Sebastian Richardson as the lead plaintiff. The case is ongoing. In response to the suit, Bureau of Prisons officials denied that Lewisburg staff are placing inmates in restraints as punishment. The bureau also objected to the claim that restraints are applied in a way that injures or prevents prisoners from eating, drinking, or using the toilet. \"Inmates in ambulatory restraints are able to take care of basic human needs without staff intervention,\" they wrote. A kind of relief came to Richardson in September 2012, when he was transferred out of Lewisburg to the supermax prison in Florence, Colo., the highest-security prison in the country. There, inmates are locked down in a single cell for almost 24 hours a day. Though Florence has been called \"America's Toughest Prison,\" for many in Lewisburg's SMU, it's seen as an escape. At Florence, they can live alone, free from the constant threat of violence. As Richardson wrote in a letter to Sprout, \"anywhere is a better place to be.\"\n",

      "3 U.S. military trainers killed in gunfire by security units at Jordan base —  At least three U.S. military trainers in Jordan were fatally shot by security forces Friday when their vehicle failed to stop at the gate of a military base, Jordanian and U.S. officials said.   The U.S. military service members “came under fire” as they approached a Jordanian training facility, said Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook. Few other details about the incident were given. Cook said U.S. and Jordanian authorities were investigating the cause.   Earlier, Jordan’s military said there was “an exchange of gunfire” after the vehicle’s driver ignored demands to stop outside an air base in southern Jordan. A Jordanian officer was injured, the statement said.   Other details of the incident at the King Faisal Air Base were not immediately clear. Investigators were trying to piece together the events, including whether a possible miscommunication was to blame.   The U.S. official said two of the service members died later in Jordan’s capital, Amman, where they were airlifted for treatment.   Jordan is a close ally of the United States, and military training by U.S. personnel is common. Jordan is also part of the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State in neighboring Syria.   [Prominent Jordanian writer gunned down]   The U.S. Embassy in Amman said in a statement it was “in contact with the appropriate Jordanian authorities, who have offered their full support.”   A U.S. diplomat in Amman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters, said American and Jordanian officials “do not believe” the incident was terrorism-related, but he offered no further details.   The King Faisal base, about 150 miles southeast of Amman and near the border with Saudi Arabia, has long been used for joint exercises between Jordan and its various allies, including the United States, Britain and Saudi Arabia. The base is also part of the network in Jordan to train Western-backed Syrian rebels.   According to U.S. diplomats and Jordanian officials, there are more than 1,000 U.S. military personnel based in Jordan, the majority serving as advisers to Jordan’s armed forces and Syrian rebel factions.   Jordan’s military has been on high alert since June, when a suicide attacker driving a bomb-rigged truck barreled through Syria’s border with Jordan, setting off a blast outside a Syrian refugee camp that killed seven Jordanian troops. It was the deadliest attack along the tense border, which hundreds of thousands of Syrians have crossed during the more than five-year conflict in their homeland.   In November 2015, a Jordanian police officer opened fire at a police training academy south of Amman, killing two U.S. contractors.\n",

That mix of fear, hope and greed has now produced a horrifying record. More people have drowned in the Mediterranean this year than ever before: at least 3,800. That's about 90 a week. It's nearly 13 every day. Here's a look at how we got to this point. Why are they doing it? They have no choice. They are Syrians, Afghans, Iraqis, escaping war. They are Nigerians and Eritreans in search of a better life. More than 65 million people have fled their homes; 1 in 3 of them are refugees. We're in the midst of the largest migration of refugees since World War II. The sheer number dwarfs the population of many countries. Would you risk these odds? Even though fewer people are crossing this year than in 2015, more people are dying as they try to make the journey. One person out of every 88 has been lost at sea trying to reach the shores of Greece, Italy or Spain. That means they're 90 times more likely to die on the journey than an American is likely to die of gunshot wounds. Where are they heading? There are three main routes across the Mediterranean. Eastern Route: Last year, the route from Turkey to Greece was the busiest by far, but a deal between the European Union and Ankara has brought the numbers down. Still, it remains a heavily trafficked route. Central Route: Libya has no government, which gives people smugglers plenty of freedom to operate out of north Africa. Traffic has been busy this year between Libya and Italy. Central Route: Libya has no government, which gives people smugglers plenty of freedom to operate out of north Africa. Traffic has been busy this year between Libya and Italy. Western Route: West Africa is far from the Middle Eastern hotspots and poor sub-Saharan African countries that produce most migrants to Europe. And relatively small numbers of people try to reach the continent from there. But even so, a steady trickle crosses the sea at the narrow point south of Spain.  Where are they fleeing from? More than a million people have fled Somalia. Nearly three million have escaped Afghanistan. But it is Syria, wracked by civil war for more than five years, that produces the most refugees: nearly five million. Just how bad is it in Syria? The Syrian refugees may outnumber any other country's refugees, but they make up less than half the number of Syrians driven from their homes by the war. Far more are internally displaced -- still in Syria, but living like refugees in the country. And then, of course, an unknown number of people have been killed in the war. International agencies stopped trying to count the dead years ago. The latest estimates by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the number somewhere around 430,000. If that's right, it means about one out of every 50 people in the country has been killed. Where do they go? President Obama vowed that the United States would resettle 10,000 Syrian refugees this year, and by August, the administration was saying it would surpass the target. Justin Trudeau vowed Canada would take 25,000 when he became prime minister last year. But far more are claiming asylum in Europe. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country would take one million refugees. And all across Europe, refugees from Syria are claiming asylum. But far more stay in the Middle East. Syria's own neighbors host the vast majority of people trying to escape the war. And there's little hope the war will end any time soon -- so the refugees will keep fleeing. And they will keep dying.\n",

      "375 top scientists warn of 'real, serious, immediate' climate threat —  Yesterday, 375 of the world’s top scientists, including 30 Nobel Prize winners, published an open letter regarding climate change. In the letter, the scientists report that the evidence is clear: humans are causing climate change. We are now observing climate change and its affect across the globe. The seas are rising, the oceans are warming, the lower atmosphere is warming, the land is warming, ice is melting, rainfall patterns are changing and the ocean is becoming more acidic. These facts are incontrovertible. No reputable scientist disputes them. It is the truth. Despite these facts, the letter reports that the US presidential campaign has seen claims that the earth isn’t warming, or it is only a natural warming, or that climate change is a hoax. These claims are false. The claims are made by politicians or real estate developers with no scientific experience. These people who deny the reality of climate change are not scientists.  These claims aren’t new. We see them every election cycle. In fact, for the Republican Party, they are a virtual litmus test for electability. It is terribly sad that the party of Lincoln (the president who initiated the National Academy of Sciences) has been rebuked by the National Academy today. It is sad that the party of Teddy Roosevelt, who created the National Park System, is acting in a way antithetical to his legacy. It is also sad that the party of Nixon, who created the Environmental Protection Agency, now is trying to eliminate that very organization. What is perhaps most sad is that the party of “fiscal conservatism” is leading us on a path that will result in higher economic and social costs for all of us. What we don’t know is what the future will bring. Will the warming be gradual or sudden? Will ocean rise increase at a faster rate or not? Will we continue to see major ice shelf collapse? Increased droughts and heat waves? Will we be able to adapt? A rational decision maker would take action to manage the risks from climate change. This threat is to our health, our communities, and our economies. A changing climate with warming seas and an acidifying ocean will cause real economic losses for our generation and for the future. In the letter, the scientists venture deeper into politics than scientists are generally willing to tread. They describe the inane Republican platform and the foolish position of the Republican nominee Donald Trump. Basically, Trump wishes to scrap our environmental agreements, which have resulted in reductions to our own emissions as well as very strong agreements to reduce global warming through international agreements.  Advertisement Despite the excellent work over the past 7 years, we have not seen the increase in energy prices that the denialists claimed would occur. Instead, we’ve seen huge reductions in the cost of wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources. We were right, they were wrong. We can deliver reliable energy to the USA at a low cost, with less pollution. We scientists have warned the country and the world about the dangers of climate change for decades. We are now seeing our predictions come true. There are no longer any reputable scientists who disagree that humans are the major factor changing the climate.  We have also seen that real action can be taken to reduce pollution. That action will not hurt our economy, rather it has built the new energy economy of the future. Despite this progress, some people want to take us backwards in time – they want to undo our progress. For those who vote in anti-science politicians who attack the scientific experts rather than our pollution problem, your legacy will be the climate change that you could have helped prevent.

      "<Title missing> —  Tundra, a 29-year old female polar bear who was living at the Detroit Zoo had passed away Monday morning after battling an illness suddenly caught the day before. The zoo wrote in a Facebook post that zoo officials decided to euthanize her after they noticed a rapid decline in her health while officials tended to her Sunday night and Monday morning. The exact illness she was suffering from has not been determined however, a necropsy will be performed in attempts to figure out the cause. “We are happy we were able to provide Tundra with a great home for the short period of time she was with us,” the zoo said. “Our hearts go out to the animal care staff and visitors – both in Detroit and Indianapolis – who knew and loved her.” Tundra was originally from the Indianapolis Zoo and had arrived at the Detroit Zoo only several months ago. Tundra was moved out of Indianapolis after renovations were being made to the polar bear exhibit where Tundra had lived alone.

Scott Carter, chief life sciences officer for the Detroit Zoological Society (DZS), told the Indianapolis Star in June: “The Arctic Ring of Life is an incredible facility for this polar bear to spend the remainder of her golden years.” Although Tundra’s time at the Detroit Zoo was short lived, visitors enjoyed seeing her in The Arctic Ring of Life habitat which is also home to two 11-year-old polar bears named Talini and Nuka as well as three foxes and five seals. On Average, polar bears in captivity live between 21-24 years, while wild polar bears pass away at an even younger age of about 15 to 18 years old.

      "<Title missing> — Tundra, a 29-year old female polar bear who was living at the Detroit Zoo had passed away Monday morning after battling an illness suddenly caught the day before. The zoo wrote in a Facebook post that zoo officials decided to euthanize her after they noticed a rapid decline in her health while officials tended to her Sunday night and Monday morning. The exact illness she was suffering from has not been determined however, a necropsy will be performed in attempts to figure out the cause. \"We are happy we were able to provide Tundra with a great home for the short period of time she was with us,\" the zoo said. \"Our hearts go out to the animal care staff and visitors – both in Detroit and Indianapolis – who knew and loved her.\" Tundra was originally from the Indianapolis Zoo and had arrived at the Detroit Zoo only several months ago. Tundra was moved out of Indianapolis after renovations were being made to the polar bear exhibit where Tundra had lived alone.

      "A Black Church Burned in the Name of Trump —  A black church in Greenville, Mississippi, was set on fire on Tuesday night. Fire fighters arrived to find Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church “heavily engulfed in flames,” Mayor Errick Simmons said in an interview;  the fire took nearly an hour to contain. No one was in the church at the time, and no one was injured. On the side of the church, beneath the blackened windows and roof, the words “Vote Trump” have been spray painted.   The fire is being investigated as a hate crime, Simmons said. Federal authorities, including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and Explosives, are helping local authorities with the investigation, which is part of the standard procedure for church fires. “We’re very cautious in this climate, in this day and time, to make sure we’re very deliberate in investigating matters like this,” Simmons said. This fire was “a direct assault on people’s right to free worship,” he said, and later added during a press conference, “I see this as an attack on the black church and the black community.”    A woman leaves a voting booth with a blue curtain, set in front of hunting trophies, in Danielsville, Pennsylvania The Disturbing Details of Trump’s Alleged Voter-Intimidation Efforts   In September, Simmons said, city officials found the word “nigger” painted on a boat front down by Greenville’s levee on the Mississippi River. The 34,000-person city is predominantly black, and while there is “a concerted, intentional effort for racial reconciliation among the races” in Greenville, he said, there have also been “cowardly acts of folks doing something.” In the days leading up to the election, the city will be placing additional patrols around all places of worship.   By and large, Simmons said, he expects the people of Greenville and the surrounding county of Washington will support Hillary Clinton.     Arson is notoriously difficult to prove.

In this case, though, someone left a calling card about politics. It’s not yet clear who set the fire, if anyone set it; whether the person who set the fire is the same person who wrote the graffiti; or why, if the fire was intentional, Hopewell M.B. Church was the target. One thing is clear, though: At some point, someone decided to attach the name of Trump to a burned black church.   This act comes with heavy symbolism in the United States. Black churches have long been burned in acts of intimidation and hatred; in the Jim Crow South, members of hate groups would leave flaming crosses on churchyard lawns.
