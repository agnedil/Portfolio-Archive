# Part 1. Naive Bayes and SVM Classifiers on Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (R)

* Part 1A. Naive Bayes by hand. NAs Ignored.

* Part 1B. Naive Bayes by hand. Using NAs in Attributes 3, 4, 6, 8.

* Part 1C. Naive Bayes using caret and klaR packages.

* Part 1D. SVMLight.

Major libraries: caret, klaR


# Part 2. Different Ways to Classify MNIST Images (Python)

* Untouched - training and testing by using scikit-learn's Gaussian, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Random Forest classifiers, Random Forest with 10, 20, and 30 trees and a depth of 4, 8, and 16 on raw images.

* Modified - same, but with cropping each MNIST image by ink boundaries and resizing to 20 x 20.

Major libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, cv2
