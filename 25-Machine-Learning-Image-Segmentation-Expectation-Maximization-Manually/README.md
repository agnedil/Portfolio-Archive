# Image Segmentation Using the Expectation Maximization Algorithm Implemented by Hand (Manually)

Applying the EM algorithm to the mixture of normal distribution model to cluster image pixels, then segmenting the image by mapping each pixel to the cluster center with the highest value of the posterior probability for that pixel. Segmenting each of the test images to 10, 20, and 50 segments and displaying the segmented images as images, where each pixel's color is replaced with the mean color of the closest segment

Segmenting a specific image to 20 segments using five different start points and displaying the result for each case
