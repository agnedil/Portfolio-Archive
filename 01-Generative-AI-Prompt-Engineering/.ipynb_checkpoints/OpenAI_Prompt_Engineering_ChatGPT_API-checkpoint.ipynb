Haiti has a lot of problems that only become exaggerated during natural disasters. I think what the Haitian people really need from the international community is help developing infrastructure so they can address these issues themselves. Foreign aid only acts as a band aid.   \n",

As someone who also grew up in the system, I can strongly relate. It's sad that America has not figured out a better and more safe system to handle kid's without parents or with parents who are unfit. A lot of the times, the system is no better, or even worse than the situation kids were in before, and I think this story is a good example of that.   \n",

So I just read this article about Iraqi Christians being persecuted by Muslims in Iraq. I don't understand why people of different religious backgrounds can't get along there. I'm sure it is a cultural thing but it is such unnecessary violence and conflict. It hurts both sides and I wish there was a way we could get them to set aside their differences. But not military action. We don't need another war.   \n",

Trying to maintain work available to support their family. I can't imagine what it would be like.   \n",

Returning to a place where a war happen is not only the repairing of the physical, but the place may have memories that you may never want to return to. For some reason, I always thought that people would just be able to return when the fighting stopped.   \n",

It is disgusting that this kind of thing is still happening and that not everyone can agree to fiercely protect these gentle giants. I get that these countries are poor and this kind of hunting and trading brings in big money for them but I think they need to look at the bigger picture and more countries should help build these countries up in others ways so they dont have to rely on this for there people and economy.

You're a lot more narrow minded as a child and getting bullied can make it seem like your entire life is ruined. I think it's a bigger problem now because of technology. Before a child would only get bullied during school hours, hopefully outside of the sight of a teacher. Now children can be bullied 24/7 through technology since everyone has a cell phone and uses social media. It's a hard problem to solve.   \n",
       "19                                                                                                                                                                                                  I just read an article about bullying in France. Apparently, the suicide of a 17 year old French girl has caused the country to reevaluate its approach toward bullying. I personally have never experienced intense bullying or ridicule first hand or even second hand. I guess I was a pretty likable kid after all. I think the key to solving problems like this is most definitely inclusion. The reason children feel this way is because they perceive themselves to be absolutely alone.   \n",

It's so heartbreaking I cannot take it. News stories don't affect me unless there is kids involved and the image of the little girls wandering around calling for her mum and the two children that lost their mother. It's horrific. It's also making me rethink rides like these because you know I love the kali river rapids at Disney which this sounds similar too. Maybe I should just stay away from rides all together. They just aren't safe.   \n",

Did maybe the kid fall off the cliff and when his father tried to save him, he also fell off? Were they running and didn't realize they were able to fall off a cliff? This is just a strange and really sad story. I hope that somebody puts fencing alongside where they fell, so this doesn't happen to anyone else.   \n",

I think that is completely unacceptable. Why wasn't there a second rescue chopper? Is there no such thing as a back up? The loss of life could have been prevented.   \n",

Even though I as not aware of the recent spike in these types of fatalities, I am aware that they happen. Years ago when I was visiting my relatives in OK there was buzz around the town about a boy of only 12 that hung himself after he was punished by his father for misbehaving. To think of someone that young taking their own life is absolutely heartbreaking.   \n",
       "24                                          It's pretty heartbreaking to hear and read stories about suicide. I have always felt like there is more that can be done for mental health with young and older people these days. It's not only the youth that struggle with it but it seems so normalized at a younger age. I feel strongly that there is no excuse for someone to kill themselves. Anything can be prevented and anyone can be helped. It's a hard time and age though and usually those kids feel like there is nothing left for them to live for when in reality they have an entire wonderful life ahead of themselves, regardless of past experiences. But that's just my opinion.   \n",

    "* `max_tokens` / int / Optional - default inf, max number of tokens in chat completion.\n",
    "* `presence_penalty` / number - default 0, range(-2.0, 2.0), increase likelihood of new topics in chat completion by using positive values.\n",
    "* `frequency_penalty` / number - default 0, range(-2.0, 2.0), decrease likelihood to repeat same line verbatim by using positive values that penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency.\n",

Math: this bias is added to logits prior to sampling. Values in range likie -1 or 1 decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 result in ban or exclusive selection of relevant token.\n",
