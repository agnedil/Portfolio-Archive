# Denoising of MNIST Images Using the Bolzman Machine

* Adding pre-determined noise to the dataset using NoiseCoordinates.csv.

* Building a Boltzman Machine for denoising the images and using the Mean-Field Inference

* Computing energy function values initially and after each iteration

* Displaying / saving the reconstructed images
