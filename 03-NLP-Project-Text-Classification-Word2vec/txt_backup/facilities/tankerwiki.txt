   An oil tanker, also known as a petroleum tanker, is a [16]merchant ship designed for the [17]bulk transport of
   [18]oil. There are two basic types of oil tankers: crude tankers and product tankers.^[19][1] Crude tankers
   move large quantities of unrefined [20]crude oil from its point of extraction to refineries.^[21][1] For
   example, moving crude oil from oil wells in Nigeria to the refineries on the coast of the United States.
   Product tankers, generally much smaller, are designed to move refined products from refineries to points near
   consuming markets. For example, moving gasoline from refineries in Europe to consumer markets in Nigeria and
   other West African nations.

   Oil tankers are often classified by their size as well as their occupation. The size classes range from inland
   or coastal tankers of a few thousand metric tons of [22]deadweight (DWT) to the mammoth ultra large crude
   carriers (ULCCs) of 550,000 [23]DWT. Tankers move approximately 2,000,000,000 metric tons (2.2 10^9 short tons)
   of oil every year.^[24][2]^[25][3] Second only to [26]pipelines in terms of efficiency,^[27][3] the average
   cost of oil transport by tanker amounts to only two or three United States cents per 1 US gallon
   (3.8 L).^[28][3]

   Some specialized types of oil tankers have evolved. One of these is the naval [29]replenishment oiler, a tanker
   which can [30]fuel a moving vessel. Combination [31]ore-bulk-oil carriers and permanently moored [32]floating
   storage units are two other variations on the standard oil tanker design. Oil tankers have been involved in a
   number of damaging and high-profile [33]oil spills. As a result, they are subject to stringent design and
   operational regulations.

History[[68]edit]

   For more details on this topic, see [69]History of the oil tanker.
   [70]Falls of Clyde is the oldest surviving American tanker and the world's only surviving sail-driven oil
   tanker.^[71][4]

   The technology of oil transportation has evolved alongside the oil industry. Although human use of oil reaches
   to prehistory, the first modern commercial exploitation dates back to [72]James Young's manufacture of
   [73]paraffin in 1850.^[74][5] In the early 1850s, oil began to be exported from [75]Upper Burma, then a
   [76]British colony. The oil was moved in earthenware vessels to the river bank where it was then poured into
   boat holds for transportation to Britain.^[77][6]

   In the 1860s, [78]Pennsylvania oil fields became a major supplier of oil, and a center of innovation after
   [79]Edwin Drake had struck oil near [80]Titusville, Pennsylvania.^[81][6] Break-bulk boats and barges were
   originally used to transport Pennsylvania oil in 40-US-gallon (150 l) wooden barrels.^[82][6] But transport by
   barrel had several problems. The first problem was weight: the standard empty barrel weighed 64 pounds (29 kg),
   representing 20% of the total weight of a full barrel.^[83][7] Other problems with barrels were their expense,
   their tendency to leak, and the fact that they were generally used only once. The expense was significant: for
   example, in the early years of the Russian oil industry, barrels accounted for half the cost of petroleum
   production.^[84][7]

Early designs[[85]edit]

   In 1863, two sail-driven tankers were built on England's [86]River Tyne.^[87][8] These were followed in 1873 by
   the first oil-tank steamer, Vaderland, which was built by [88]Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company for Belgian
   owners.^[89][8]^[90][9] The vessel's use was curtailed by U.S. and Belgian authorities citing safety
   concerns.^[91][10] By 1871, the Pennsylvania oil fields were making limited use of oil tank barges and
   cylindrical railroad tank-cars similar to those in use today.^[92][6]

Modern oil tankers[[93]edit]

   The modern oil tanker was developed in the period from 1877 to 1885.^[94][11] In 1876, [95]Ludvig and
   [96]Robert Nobel, brothers of [97]Alfred Nobel, founded [98]Branobel (short for Brothers Nobel) in [99]Baku,
   [100]Azerbaijan. It was, during the late 19th century, one of the largest [101]oil companies in the world.
   Zoroaster, the world's first tanker, delivered to the Nobel brothers in Russia.

   Ludvig was a pioneer in the development of early oil tankers. He first experimented with carrying oil in bulk
   on single-hulled barges.^[102][7] Turning his attention to self-propelled tankships, he faced a number of
   challenges. A primary concern was to keep the cargo and fumes well away from the engine room to avoid
   fires.^[103][12] Other challenges included allowing for the cargo to expand and contract due to temperature
   changes, and providing a method to ventilate the tanks.^[104][12]

   The first successful oil tanker was Zoroaster, which carried its 242 long tons of kerosene cargo in two iron
   tanks joined by pipes.^[105][12] One tank was forward of the midships engine room and the other was
   aft.^[106][12] The ship also featured a set of 21 vertical watertight compartments for extra
   [107]buoyancy.^[108][12] The ship had a length overall of 184 feet (56 m), a [109]beam of 27 feet (8.2 m), and
   a [110]draft of 9 feet (2.7 m).^[111][12] Unlike later Nobel tankers, the Zoroaster design was built small
   enough to sail from [112]Sweden to the [113]Caspian by way of the [114]Baltic Sea, [115]Lake Ladoga, [116]Lake
   Onega, the [117]Rybinsk and [118]Mariinsk Canals and the [119]Volga River.^[120][12]

   In 1883, oil tanker design took a large step forward. Working for the Nobel company, British engineer Colonel
   Henry F. Swan designed a set of three Nobel tankers.^[121][13] Instead of one or two large holds, Swan's design
   used several holds which spanned the width, or beam, of the ship.^[122][13] These holds were further subdivided
   into port and starboard sections by a longitudinal bulkhead.^[123][13] Earlier designs suffered from stability
   problems caused by the [124]free surface effect, where oil sloshing from side to side could cause a ship to
   capsize.^[125][14] But this approach of dividing the ship's storage space into smaller tanks virtually
   eliminated [126]free-surface problems.^[127][14] This approach, almost universal today, was first used by Swan
   in the Nobel tankers Blesk, Lumen, and Lux.^[128][13]^[129][15]
   [130]Gl ckauf grounded in heavy fog at [131]Blue Point Beach on [132]Fire Island.

   Others point to [133]Gluckauf, another design of Colonel Swan, as being the first modern oil tanker. It adopted
   the best practices from previous oil tanker designs to create the prototype for all subsequent vessels of the
   type. It was the first dedicated steam-driven ocean-going tanker in the world and was the first ship in which
   oil could be pumped directly into the vessel hull instead of being loaded in barrels or
   drums.^[134][16]^[135][17] It was also the first tanker with a horizontal
   bulkhead;^[136][18]^[[137]page needed] its features included cargo valves operable from the deck, cargo main
   piping, a vapor line, [138]cofferdams for added safety, and the ability to fill a [139]ballast tank with
   seawater when empty of cargo.^[140][19] The ship was built in Britain.^[141][20] and was purchased by Wilhelm
   Anton Riedemann, an agent for the [142]Standard Oil Company along with several of her [143]sister
   ships.^[144][19] After Gluckauf was lost in 1893 after being [145]grounded in fog, Standard Oil purchased the
   sister ships.^[146][19]

Asian trade[[147]edit]

   A [148]Royal Dutch Petroleum dock in the [149]Dutch East Indies (now [150]Indonesia)

   The 1880s also saw the beginnings of the Asian oil trade.^[151][19] The idea that led to moving Russian oil to
   the Far East via the Suez Canal was the brainchild of two men: importer [152]Marcus Samuel and shipowner/broker
   Fred Lane.^[153][19] Prior bids to move oil through the canal had been rejected by the [154]Suez Canal Company
   as being too risky.^[155][19] Samuel approached the problem a different way: asking the company for the
   specifications of a tanker it would allow through the canal.^[156][19]

   Armed with the canal company's specifications, Samuel ordered three tankers from [157]William Gray & Company in
   northern England.^[158][19] Named [159]Murex, Conch and Clam, each had a capacity of 5,010 long tons of
   deadweight.^[160][19] These three ships were the first tankers of the Tank Syndicate, forerunner of today's
   [161]Royal Dutch Shell company.^[162][19]

   With facilities prepared in [163]Jakarta, [164]Singapore, [165]Bangkok, [166]Saigon, [167]Hong Kong,
   [168]Shanghai, and [169]Kobe, the fledgling Shell company was ready to become Standard Oil's first challenger
   in the Asian market.^[170][19] On August 24, 1892, Murex became the first tanker to pass through the [171]Suez
   Canal.^[172][19] By the time Shell merged with Royal Dutch Petroleum in 1907, the company had 34 steam-driven
   oil tankers, compared to Standard Oil's four case-oil steamers and 16 sailing tankers.^[173][19]

The supertanker era[[174]edit]

   Until 1956, tankers were designed to be able to navigate the Suez Canal.^[175][21] This size restriction became
   much less of a priority after the closing of the canal during the [176]Suez Crisis of 1956.^[177][21] Forced to
   move oil around the [178]Cape of Good Hope, shipowners realized that bigger tankers were the key to more
   efficient transport.^[179][21]^[180][22] While a typical [181]T2 tanker of the World War II era was 532 feet
   (162 m) long and had a capacity of 16,500 [182]DWT, the ultra-large crude carriers (ULCC) built in the 1970s
   were over 1,300 feet (400 m) long and had a capacity of 500,000 [183]DWT.^[184][23] Several factors encouraged
   this growth. Hostilities in the [185]Middle East which interrupted traffic through the Suez Canal contributed,
   as did nationalization of Middle East [186]oil refineries.^[187][22] Fierce competition among shipowners also
   played a part.^[188][22] But apart from these considerations is a simple economic advantage: the larger an oil
   tanker is, the more cheaply it can move crude oil, and the better it can help meet growing demands for
   oil.^[189][22]

   In 1955 the world's largest supertanker was 30,708 [190]GRT^[191][24] and 47,500 LT [192]DWT:^[193][25] SS
   Spyros Niarchos launched that year by [194]Vickers Armstrongs Shipbuilders Ltd in [195]England for [196]Stavros
   Niarchos.

   In 1958 United States shipping magnate Daniel K. Ludwig broke the record of 100,000 long tons of heavy
   displacement.^[197][26] His Universe Apollo displaced 104,500 long tons, a 23% increase from the previous
   record-holder, Universe Leader which also belonged to Ludwig.^[198][26]^[199][27]
   [200]Knock Nevis, ex Seawise Giant rivaled some of the world's largest buildings in size

   The world's largest supertanker was built in 1979 at the [201]Oppama shipyard by [202]Sumitomo Heavy
   Industries, Ltd., named [203]Seawise Giant. This ship was built with a capacity of 564,763 [204]DWT, a
   [205]length overall of 458.45 metres (1,504.1 ft) and a draft of 24.611 metres (80.74 ft).^[206][28] She had 46
   tanks, 31,541 square metres (339,500 sq ft) of deck, and at her full load draft, could not navigate the
   [207]English Channel.^[208][29]

   Seawise Giant was renamed Happy Giant in 1989, Jahre Viking in 1991,^[209][28] and Knock Nevis in 2004 (when
   she was converted into a permanently moored storage tanker).^[210][29]^[211][30] In 2009 she was sold for the
   last time, renamed Mont, and [212]scrapped.^[213][31]

   As of 2011, the world's two largest working supertankers are the [214]TI-class supertankers TI Europe and TI
   Oceania.^[215][32]^[216][33] These ships were built in 2002 and 2003 as Hellespont Alhambra and Hellespont Tara
   for the Greek Hellespont Steamship Corporation.^[217][34] Hellespont sold these ships to [218]Overseas
   Shipholding Group and [219]Euronav in 2004.^[220][35] Each of the sister ships has a capacity of over
   441,500 [221]DWT, a length overall of 380.0 metres (1,246.7 ft) and a cargo capacity of 3,166,353 barrels
   (503,409,900 l).^[222][36] They were the first ULCCs to be double-hulled.^[223][34] To differentiate them from
   smaller ULCCs, these ships are sometimes given the V-Plus size designation.^[224][36]^[225][37]

   With the exception of the pipeline, the tanker is the most cost-effective way to move oil today.^[226][38]
   Worldwide, tankers carry some 2 billion barrels (3.2 10^11 l) annually, and the cost of transportation by
   tanker amounts to only US$0.02 per [227]gallon at the pump.^[228][38]

   In 1954 [242]Shell Oil developed the [243]average freight rate assessment (AFRA) system which classifies
   tankers of different sizes. To make it an independent instrument, Shell consulted the [244]London Tanker
   Brokers' Panel (LTBP). At first, they divided the groups as General Purpose for tankers under 25,000 tons
   [245]deadweight (DWT); Medium Range for ships between 25,000 and 45,000 [246]DWT and Large Range for the
   then-enormous ships that were larger than 45,000 [247]DWT. The ships became larger during the 1970s, which
   prompted rescaling.^[248][39]

   The system was developed for tax reasons as the tax authorities wanted evidence that the internal billing
   records were correct. Before the [249]New York Mercantile Exchange started trading crude oil [250]futures in
   1983, it was difficult to determine the exact price of oil, which could change with every contract. Shell and
   [251]BP, the first companies to use the system, abandoned the AFRA system in 1983, later followed by the US oil
   companies. However, the system is still used today. Besides that, there is the flexible market scale, which
   takes typical routes and lots of 500,000 barrels (79,000 m^3).^[252][42]

   Merchant oil tankers carry a wide range of hydrocarbon liquids ranging from crude oil to refined petroleum
   products.^[253][1] Their size is measured in [254]deadweight metric tons (DWT). Crude carriers are among the
   largest, ranging from 55,000 [255]DWT [256]Panamax-sized vessels to ultra-large crude carriers (ULCCs) of over
   440,000 [257]DWT.^[258][43]

   Smaller tankers, ranging from well under 10,000 [259]DWT to 80,000 [260]DWT Panamax vessels, generally carry
   refined petroleum products, and are known as product tankers.^[261][43] The smallest tankers, with capacities
   under 10,000 [262]DWT generally work near-coastal and inland waterways.^[263][43] Although they were in the
   past, ships of the smaller [264]Aframax and [265]Suezmax classes are no longer regarded as
   supertankers.^[266][44]

Supertankers (VLCC and ULCC)[[267]edit]

   [268]Knock Nevis (1979-2010), a ULCC supertanker and the longest ship ever built.

   "Supertankers" are the largest tankers, including very large crude carriers (VLCC) and ULCCs with capacities
   over 250,000 [269]DWT. These ships can transport 2,000,000 barrels (320,000 m^3) of oil/318,000 metric
   tons.^[270][43] By way of comparison, the United Kingdom consumed about 1.6 million barrels (250,000 m^3) of
   oil per day in 2009.^[271][45] ULCCs, commissioned in the 1970s, were the largest vessels ever built, but the
   longest ones have already been scrapped. By 2013 only a few ULCCs remain in service, none of which are more
   than 400 meters long.^[272][46]

   Because of their great size, supertankers often cannot enter port fully loaded.^[273][22] These ships can take
   on their cargo at off-shore platforms and [274]single-point moorings.^[275][22] On the other end of the
   journey, they often pump their cargo off to smaller tankers at designated [276]lightering points
   off-coast.^[277][22] Supertanker routes are typically long, requiring them to stay at sea for extended periods,
   often around seventy days at a time.^[278][22]

Chartering[[279]edit]

   Oil tanker at [280]Guanabara Bay, in [281]Rio de Janeiro, [282]Brazil.

   The act of hiring a ship to carry cargo is called chartering. Tankers are hired by four types of charter
   agreements: the [283]voyage charter, the [284]time charter, the [285]bareboat charter, and [286]contract of
   affreightment.^[287][47] In a voyage charter the charterer rents the vessel from the loading port to the
   discharge port.^[288][47] In a time charter the vessel is hired for a set period of time, to perform voyages as
   the charterer directs.^[289][47] In a bareboat charter the charterer acts as the ship's operator and manager,
   taking on responsibilities such as providing the crew and maintaining the vessel.^[290][48] Finally, in a
   contract of affreightment or COA, the charterer specifies a total volume of cargo to be carried in a specific
   time period and in specific sizes, for example a COA could be specified as 1 million barrels (160,000 m^3) of
   JP-5 in a year's time in 25,000-barrel (4,000 m^3) shipments.^[291][49] A completed chartering contract is
   known as a [292]charter party.^[293][49]

   One of the key aspects of any charter party is the [294]freight rate, or the price specified for carriage of
   cargo.^[295][50] The freight rate of a tanker charter party is specified in one of four ways: by a lump sum
   rate, by rate per ton, by a time charter equivalent rate, or by [296]Worldscale rate.^[297][50] In a lump sum
   rate arrangement, a fixed price is negotiated for the delivery of a specified cargo, and the ship's
   owner/operator is responsible to pay for all port costs and other voyage expenses.^[298][51] Rate per ton
   arrangements are used mostly in chemical tanker chartering, and differ from lump sum rates in that port costs
   and voyage expenses are generally paid by the charterer.^[299][52] Time charter arrangements specify a daily
   rate, and port costs and voyage expenses are also generally paid by the charterer.^[300][52]

   The Worldwide Tanker Normal Freight Scale, often referred to as Worldscale, is established and governed jointly
   by the Worldscale Associations of London and New York.^[301][50] Worldscale establishes a baseline price for
   carrying a metric ton of product between any two ports in the world.^[302][53] In Worldscale negotiations,
   operators and charterers will determine a price based on a percentage of the Worldscale rate.^[303][53] The
   baseline rate is expressed as WS 100.^[304][53] If a given charter party settled on 85% of the Worldscale rate,
   it would be expressed as WS 85.^[305][53] Similarly, a charter party set at 125% of the Worldscale rate would
   be expressed as WS 125.^[306][53]

   As of 2007^[316][update], the chartering market is persistently volatile across all tanker sectors.^[317][55]
   The market is affected by a wide variety of variables such as the supply and demand of oil as well as the
   supply and demand of oil tankers. Some particular variables include winter temperatures, excess tanker tonnage,
   supply fluctuations in the [318]Persian Gulf, and interruptions in refinery services.^[319][55]

   In 2006, the sustained rise in oil prices had only a limited impact on demand.^[320][58] It was a good year
   across all segments of the tanker market segments, but not as good as 2004 and 2005.^[321][58] Amidst high oil
   prices, geopolitical tension, and fears of disruptions to the oil supply, growing demand was the main driving
   force in the tanker shipping market for the year.^[322][58] As demand grew moderately in the United States and
   Western Europe, expanding economies such as China fueled exponential growth in demand.^[323][58] Despite these
   strengths, each of the five tanker freight indices dropped during 2006.^[324][58] Product tanker demand
   increased in 2006 due to economic expansion in Asia, especially China and India, however, average time charter
   equivalent earnings for these ships decreased compared with the two prior years.^[325][57]

   In 2006, time-charters tended towards long term. Of the time charters executed in that year, 58% were for a
   period of 24 or more months, 14% were for periods of 12 to 24 months, 4% were from 6 to 12 months, and 24% were
   for periods of less than 6 months.^[326][57] The average one-year time charter rate for a 5-year-old tanker of
   280,000 metric tons of deadweight varied from $56,500 per day in December 2005 to $53,000 per day in September
   2007 with a high of $64,500 per day in September 2006.^[327][57]

   The first half of 2007 was relatively strong, but in the second half rates dropped significantly. A sudden rise
   in oil production, longer transport routes, and [328]slow steaming because of high [329]bunker prices led to a
   shortage in tonnage towards the end of the year. Overnight, VLCC rates climbed from $20,000 per day to
   $200-$300,000 per day, and even higher numbers were recorded.^[330][59]

   From 2003, the demand for new ships started to grow, resulting in 2007 in a record breaking order backlog for
   shipyards, exceeding their capacity with rising newbuilding prices as a result.^[331][60] This resulted in a
   glut of ships when demand dropped due to a weakened global economy and dramatically reduced demand in the
   United States. The charter rate for very large crude carriers, which carry two million barrels of oil, had
   peaked at $309,601 per day in 2007, and has dropped, as of 2012, to $7,085 per day, far below the operating
   costs of these ships.^[332][61] As a result, several tanker operators laid up their ships. Prices rose
   significantly in 2015 and early 2016, but delivery of new tankers was projected to keep prices in
   check.^[333][54]

   In 2005, oil tankers made up 36.9% of the world's fleet in terms of deadweight tonnage.^[375][63] The world's
   total oil tankers deadweight tonnage has increased from 326.1 million [376]DWT in 1970 to 960.0
   million [377]DWT in 2005.^[378][63] The combined deadweight tonnage of oil tankers and bulk carriers,
   represents 72.9% of the world's fleet.^[379][64]

   In 2005, 2.42 billion metric tons of oil were shipped by tanker. In 2006, 76.7% of this was crude oil, and the
   rest consisted of refined petroleum products. This amounted to 34.1% of all seaborne trade for the year.
   Combining the amount carried with the distance it was carried, oil tankers moved 11,705 billion
   metric-ton-miles of oil in 2005.

   By comparison, in 1970 1.44 billion metric tons of oil were shipped by tanker. This amounted to 34.1% of all
   seaborne trade for that year. In terms of amount carried and distance carried, oil tankers moved 6,487 billion
   metric-ton-miles of oil in 1970.

   The United Nations also keeps statistics about oil tanker productivity, stated in terms of metric tons carried
   per metric ton of deadweight as well as metric-ton-miles of carriage per metric ton of deadweight. 2006 In
   2005, for each 1 [387]DWT of oil tankers, 6.7 metric tons of cargo was carried. Similarly, each 1 [388]DWT of
   oil tankers was responsible for 32,400 metric-ton miles of carriage.

   The main loading ports in 2005 were located in Western Asia, Western Africa, North Africa, and the Caribbean,
   with 196.3, 196.3, 130.2 and 246.6 million metric tons of cargo loaded in these regions. The main discharge
   ports were located in North America, Europe, and Japan with 537.7, 438.4, and 215.0 million metric tons of
   cargo discharged in these regions.

Flag states[[389]edit]

   International law requires that every merchant ship be registered in a country, called its [390]flag
   state.^[391][65] A ship's flag state exercises regulatory control over the vessel and is required to inspect it
   regularly, certify the ship's equipment and crew, and issue safety and pollution prevention documents. As of
   2007, the United States [392]Central Intelligence Agency statistics count 4,295 oil tankers of 1,000 long tons
   [393]deadweight (DWT) or greater worldwide.^[394][66] [395]Panama was the world's largest [396]flag state for
   oil tankers, with 528 of the vessels in its registry.^[397][66] Six other flag states had more than 200
   registered oil tankers: [398]Liberia (464), [399]Singapore (355), China (252), Russia (250), the [400]Marshall
   Islands (234) and the [401]Bahamas (209).^[402][66] The Panamanian, Liberian, Marshallese and Bahamian flags
   are open registries and considered by the [403]International Transport Workers' Federation to be [404]flags of
   convenience.^[405][67] By comparison, the United States and the United Kingdom only had 59 and 27 registered
   oil tankers, respectively.^[406][66]

Vessel life cycle[[407]edit]

   Tankers may carry unusual cargoes - such as grain - on their final trip to the scrapyard.

   In 2005, the average age of oil tankers worldwide was 10 years.^[408][68] Of these, 31.6% were under 4 years
   old and 14.3% were over 20 years old.^[409][69] In 2005, 475 new oil tankers were built, accounting for 30.7
   million [410]DWT.^[411][70] The average size for these new tankers was 64,632 [412]DWT.^[413][70] Nineteen of
   these were VLCC size, 19 were suezmax, 51 were aframax, and the rest were smaller designs.^[414][70] By
   comparison, 8.0 million [415]DWT, 8.7 million [416]DWT, and 20.8 million [417]DWT worth of oil tanker capacity
   was built in 1980, 1990, and 2000 respectively.^[418][70]

   Ships are generally removed from the fleet through a process known as [419]scrapping.^[420][71] Ship-owners and
   buyers negotiate scrap prices based on factors such as the ship's empty weight (called light ton displacement
   or LDT) and prices in the scrap metal market.^[421][72] In 1998 almost 700 ships went through the scrapping
   process at shipbreakers in places like [422]Alang, India and [423]Chittagong, Bangladesh.^[424][71] In 2004 and
   2005, 7.8 million [425]DWT and 5.7 million [426]DWT respectively of oil tankers were scrapped.^[427][68]
   Between 2000 and 2005, the capacity of oil tankers scrapped each year has ranged between 5.6 million [428]DWT
   and 18.4 million [429]DWT.^[430][73] In this same timeframe, tankers have accounted for between 56.5% and 90.5%
   of the world's total scrapped ship tonnage.^[431][73] In this period the average age of scrapped oil tankers
   has ranged from 26.9 to 31.5 years.^[432][73]

Vessel pricing[[433]edit]

             Size              1985     2005
   32,000-45,000 [434]DWT   [435]US$18M $43M
   80,000-105,000 [436]DWT  $22M        $58M
   250,000-280,000 [437]DWT $47M        $120M

   In 2005, the price for new oil tankers in the 32,000-45,000 [438]DWT, 80,000-105,000 [439]DWT, and
   250,000-280,000 [440]DWT ranges were [441]US$43 million, $58 million, and $120 million respectively.^[442][74]
   In 1985 these vessels would have cost $18 million, $22 million, and $47 million respectively.^[443][74]

   Oil tankers are often sold second-hand. In 2005, 27.3 million [444]DWT worth of oil tankers were sold
   used.^[445][75] Some representative prices for that year include $42.5M for a 40,000 [446]DWT tanker, $60.7
   million for a 80,000-95,000 [447]DWT, $73 million for a 130,000-150,000 [448]DWT, and $116 million for
   250,000-280,000 [449]DWT tanker.^[450][75] For a concrete example, in 2006, [451]Bonheur subsidiary First Olsen
   paid US$76.5 million for Knock Sheen, a 159,899 DWT tanker.^[452][76]

   The cost of operating the largest tankers, the Very Large Crude Carriers, is currently between $10,000 and
   $12,000 per day.^[453][77]^[454][78]

Current structural design[[455]edit]

   For more details on this topic, see [456]Architecture of the oil tanker.

   Oil tankers generally have from 8 to 12 tanks.^[457][15] Each tank is split into two or three independent
   compartments by fore-and-aft bulkheads.^[458][15] The tanks are numbered with tank one being the forwardmost.
   Individual compartments are referred to by the tank number and the athwartships position, such as "one port",
   "three starboard", or "six center."^[459][15]

   A cofferdam is a small little space left open between two bulkheads, to give protection from heat, fire, or
   collision.^[460][15] Tankers generally have cofferdams forward and aft of the cargo tanks, and sometimes
   between individual tanks.^[461][79] A pumpable room houses all the pumps connected to a tanker's cargo
   lines.^[462][15] Some larger tankers have two pumprooms.^[463][15] A pumproom generally spans the total breadth
   of the ship.^[464][15]

Hull designs[[465]edit]

   Single hull, double bottom, and double hull ship cross sections. Green lines are watertight; black structure is
   not watertight

   A major component of tanker architecture is the design of the hull or outer structure. A tanker with a single
   outer shell between the product and the ocean is said to be "single-hulled".^[466][80] Most newer tankers are
   "[467]double hulled", with an extra space between the hull and the storage tanks.^[468][80] Hybrid designs such
   as "double-bottom" and "double-sided" combine aspects of single and double-hull designs.^[469][80] All
   single-hulled tankers around the world will be phased out by 2026, in accordance with the [470]International
   Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (MARPOL).^[471][80] The United Nations has decided
   to phase out single hull oil tankers by 2010.^[472][81]

   In 1998, the Marine Racecar Board of the [473]National Academy of Science conducted a survey of industry
   experts regarding the pros and cons of double-hull design. Some of the advantages of the double-hull design
   that were mentioned include ease of ballasting in emergency situations,^[474][82] reduced practice of saltwater
   ballasting in cargo tanks decreases corrosion,^[475][83] increased environmental protection,^[476][83] cargo
   discharge is quicker, more complete and easier,^[477][83] tank washing is more efficient,^[478][83] and better
   protection in low-impact collisions and grounding.^[479][83]

   The same report lists the following as some drawbacks to the double-hull design, including higher build
   costs,^[480][84] greater operating expenses (e.g. higher canal and port tariffs),^[481][84] difficulties in
   ballast tank ventilation,^[482][84] the fact that ballast tanks need continuous monitoring and
   maintenance,^[483][84] increased transverse free surface,^[484][84] the greater number of surfaces to
   maintain,^[485][84] the risk of explosions in double-hull spaces if a vapor detection system not
   fitted,^[486][85] and that cleaning ballast tanks is more difficult for double hull ships.^[487][85]

   In all, double-hull tankers are said to be safer than a single-hull in a grounding incident, especially when
   the shore is not very rocky.^[488][86] The safety benefits are less clear on larger vessels and in cases of
   high speed impact.^[489][83]

   Although double-hull design is superior in low energy casualties and prevents spillage in small casualties, in
   high energy casualties where both hulls are breached, oil can spill through the double-hull and into the sea
   and spills from a double-hull tanker can be significantly higher than designs like the [490]mid-deck tanker,
   the [491]Coulombi egg tanker and even a pre-MARPOL tanker, as the last one has a lower oil column and reaches
   [492]hydrostatic balance sooner.^[493][87]

Inert gas system[[494]edit]

   An oil tanker's inert gas system is one of the most important parts of its design.^[495][88] Fuel oil itself is
   very difficult to ignite, but its [496]hydrocarbon vapors are explosive when mixed with air in certain
   concentrations.^[497][89] The purpose of the system is to create an atmosphere inside tanks in which the
   hydrocarbon oil vapors cannot burn.^[498][88]

   As inert gas is introduced into a mixture of hydrocarbon vapors and air, it increases the [499]lower flammable
   limit or lowest concentration at which the vapors can be ignited.^[500][90] At the same time it decreases the
   [501]upper flammable limit or highest concentration at which the vapors can be ignited.^[502][90] When the
   total concentration of oxygen in the tank reaches about 11%, the upper and lower flammable limits converge and
   the flammable range disappears.^[503][91]

   Inert gas systems deliver air with an oxygen concentration of less than 5% by volume.^[504][88] As a tank is
   pumped out, it is filled with inert gas and kept in this safe state until the next cargo is loaded.^[505][92]
   The exception is in cases when the tank must be entered.^[506][92] Safely gas-freeing a tank is accomplished by
   purging hydrocarbon vapors with inert gas until the hydrocarbon concentration inside the tank is under about
   1%.^[507][92] Thus, as air replaces the inert gas, the concentration cannot rise to the lower flammable limit
   and is safe.^[508][92]

Cargo operations[[509]edit]

   Cargo flows between a tanker and a shore station by way of [510]marine loading arms attached at the tanker's
   cargo manifold.

   Operations aboard oil tankers are governed by an established body of best practices and a large body of
   international law.^[511][93] Cargo can be moved on or off of an oil tanker in several ways. One method is for
   the ship to moor alongside a pier, connect with cargo hoses or [512]marine loading arms. Another method
   involves mooring to offshore [513]buoys, such as a single point mooring, and making a cargo connection via
   underwater cargo hoses.^[514][94] A third method is by ship-to-ship transfer, also known as [515]lightering. In
   this method, two ships come alongside in open sea and oil is transferred manifold to manifold via flexible
   hoses.^[516][95] Lightering is sometimes used where a loaded tanker is too large to enter a specific
   port.^[517][95]

Pre-transfer preparation[[518]edit]

   Prior to any transfer of cargo, the [519]chief officer must develop a transfer plan detailing specifics of the
   operation such as how much cargo will be moved, which tanks will be cleaned, and how the ship's ballasting will
   change.^[520][96] The next step before a transfer is the pretransfer conference.^[521][97] The pretransfer
   conference covers issues such as what products will be moved, the order of movement, names and titles of key
   people, particulars of shipboard and shore equipment, critical states of the transfer, regulations in effect,
   emergency and spill-containment procedures, watch and shift arrangements, and shutdown procedures.^[522][97]

   After the conference is complete, the person in charge on the ship and the person in charge of the shore
   installation go over a final inspection checklist.^[523][97] In the United States, the checklist is called a
   Declaration of Inspection or DOI.^[524][97] Outside the U.S., the document is called the "Ship/Shore Safety
   Checklist."^[525][97] Items on the checklist include proper signals and signs are displayed,^[526][97] secure
   mooring of the vessel,^[527][97] choice of language for communication,^[528][98] securing of all
   connections,^[529][98] that emergency equipment is in place,^[530][98] and that no repair work is taking
   place.^[531][98]

Loading cargo[[532]edit]

   Oil is pumped on and off the ship by way of connections made at the cargo manifold.

   Loading an oil tanker consists primarily of pumping cargo into the ship's tanks.^[533][98] As oil enters the
   tank, the vapors inside the tank must be somehow expelled.^[534][98] Depending on local regulations, the vapors
   can be expelled into the atmosphere or discharged back to the pumping station by way of a vapor recovery
   line.^[535][98] It is also common for the ship to move water ballast during the loading of cargo to maintain
   proper trim.^[536][98]

   Loading starts slowly at a low pressure to ensure that equipment is working correctly and that connections are
   secure.^[537][98] Then a steady pressure is achieved and held until the "topping-off" phase when the tanks are
   nearly full.^[538][98] Topping off is a very dangerous time in handling oil, and the procedure is handled
   particularly carefully.^[539][98] Tank-gauging equipment is used to tell the person in charge how much space is
   left in the tank, and all tankers have at least two independent methods for tank-gauging.^[540][98] As the
   tanker becomes full, crew members open and close valves to direct the flow of product and maintain close
   communication with the pumping facility to decrease and finally stop the flow of liquid.^[541][98]

Unloading cargo[[542]edit]

   This cargo pump aboard a VLCC can move 5,000 cubic meters of product per hour.

   The process of moving oil off of a tanker is similar to loading, but has some key differences.^[543][99] The
   first step in the operation is following the same pretransfer procedures as used in loading.^[544][100] When
   the transfer begins, it is the ship's cargo pumps that are used to move the product ashore.^[545][100] As in
   loading, the transfer starts at low pressure to ensure that equipment is working correctly and that connections
   are secure.^[546][100] Then a steady pressure is achieved and held during the operation.^[547][101] While
   pumping, tank levels are carefully watched and key locations, such as the connection at the cargo manifold and
   the ship's pumproom are constantly monitored.^[548][99] Under the direction of the person in charge, crew
   members open and close valves to direct the flow of product and maintain close communication with the receiving
   facility to decrease and finally stop the flow of liquid.^[549][99]

Tank cleaning[[550]edit]

   The nozzle of an automated tank cleaning machine

   Tanks must be cleaned from time to time for various reasons. One reason is to change the type of product
   carried inside a tank.^[551][102] Also, when tanks are to be inspected or maintenance must be performed within
   a tank, it must be not only cleaned, but made gas-free.^[552][102]

   On most crude-oil tankers, a special [553]crude oil washing (COW) system is part of the cleaning
   process.^[554][102] The COW system circulates part of the cargo through the fixed tank-cleaning system to
   remove wax and asphaltic deposits.^[555][102] Tanks that carry less viscous cargoes are washed with water.
   Fixed and portable [556]automated tank cleaning machines, which clean tanks with high-pressure water jets, are
   widely used.^[557][102] Some systems use rotating high-pressure water jets to spray hot water on all the
   internal surfaces of the tank.^[558][102] As the spraying takes place, the liquid is pumped out of the
   tank.^[559][102]

   After a tank is cleaned, provided that it is going to be prepared for entry, it will be purged. Purging is
   accomplished by pumping inert gas into the tank until hydrocarbons have been sufficiently expelled. Next the
   tank is gas freed which is usually accomplished by blowing fresh air into the space with portable air powered
   or water powered air blowers. "Gas freeing" brings the oxygen content of the tank up to 20.8% O2. The inert gas
   buffer between fuel and oxygen atmospheres ensures they are never capable of ignition. Specially trained
   personnel monitor the tank's atmosphere, often using hand-held gas indicators which measure the percentage of
   hydrocarbons present.^[560][103] After a tank is gas-free, it may be further hand-cleaned in a manual process
   known as mucking.^[561][104] Mucking requires protocols for entry into [562]confined spaces, [563]protective
   clothing, designated safety observers, and possibly the use of [564]airline respirators.^[565][104]

Special-use oil tankers[[566]edit]

   Some sub-types of oil tankers have evolved to meet specific military and economic needs. These sub-types
   include naval replenishment ships, oil-bulk-ore combination carriers, floating storage and offloading units
   (FSOs) and floating production storage and offloading units (FPSOs).

Replenishment ships[[567]edit]

   Main article: [568]Replenishment oiler
   [569]HMAS Success refuels [570]USS Kitty Hawk and [571]USS Cowpens.

   Replenishment ships, known as oilers in the United States and fleet tankers in Commonwealth countries, are
   ships that can provide oil products to naval vessels while on the move. This process, called [572]underway
   replenishment, extends the length of time a naval vessel can stay at sea, as well as her effective
   range.^[573][105] Prior to underway replenishment, naval vessels had to enter a port or anchor to take on
   fuel.^[574][106] In addition to fuel, replenishment ships may also deliver water, ammunition, rations, stores
   and personnel.^[575][107]

Ore-bulk-oil carriers[[576]edit]

   Main article: [577]Ore-bulk-oil carrier
   The OBO-carrier Maya. The picture is showing both the cargo hold hatches used for bulk and the pipes used for
   oil

   An ore-bulk-oil carrier, also known as combination carrier or OBO, is a ship designed to be capable of carrying
   wet or dry [578]bulk cargoes.^[579][108] This design was intended to provide flexibility in two
   ways.^[580][109] Firstly, an OBO would be able to switch between the dry and wet bulk trades based on market
   conditions.^[581][109] Secondly, an OBO could carry oil on one leg of a voyage and return carrying dry bulk,
   reducing the number of unprofitable [582]ballast voyages it would have to make.^[583][110]

   In practice, the flexibility which the OBO design allows has gone largely unused, as these ships tend to
   specialize in either the liquid or dry bulk trade.^[584][110] Also, these ships have endemic maintenance
   problems.^[585][109] On one hand, due to a less specialized design, an OBO suffers more from wear and tear
   during dry cargo onload than a bulker.^[586][109] On the other hand, components of the liquid cargo system,
   from pumps to valves to piping, tend to develop problems when subjected to periods of disuse.^[587][109] These
   factors have contributed to a steady reduction in the number of OBO ships worldwide since the 1970s.^[588][110]

   One of the more famous OBOs was the [589]MV Derbyshire of 180,000 [590]DWT which in September 1980 became the
   largest British ship ever lost at sea.^[591][108] It sank in a Pacific [592]typhoon while carrying a cargo of
   iron ore from Canada to Japan.^[593][108]

Floating storage units[[594]edit]

   Main articles: [595]Floating storage and offloading unit and [596]Floating production storage and offloading
   unit
   Floating storage units, often former oil tankers, accumulate oil for tankers to retrieve.

   Floating storage and offloading units (FSO) are used worldwide by the offshore oil industry to receive oil from
   nearby platforms and store it until it can be offloaded onto oil tankers.^[597][111] A similar system, the
   floating production storage and offloading unit (FPSO), has the ability to process the product while it is on
   board.^[598][111] These floating units reduce oil production costs and offer mobility, large storage capacity,
   and production versatility.^[599][111]

   FPSO and FSOs are often created out of old, stripped-down oil tankers, but can be made from new-built
   hulls^[600][111] [601]Shell Espa a first used a tanker as an FPSO in August 1977.^[602][112] An example of a
   FSO that used to be an oil tanker is the [603]Knock Nevis.^[604][28] These units are usually moored to the
   seabed through a spread mooring system.^[605][111] A turret-style mooring system can be used in areas prone to
   severe weather.^[606][111] This turret system lets the unit rotate to minimize the effects of sea-swell and
   wind.^[607][111]

Pollution[[608]edit]

   Main article: [609]Oil spill
   [610]Exxon Valdez spilled 10.8 million US gallons (41,000 m^3) of oil into Alaska's [611]Prince William
   Sound.^[612][113]
   Demonstration in Canada against oil tankers, 1970.

   Oil spills have devastating effects on the environment. Crude oil contains [613]polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) which are very difficult to clean up, and last for years in the [614]sediment and marine
   environment.^[615][114] Marine species constantly exposed to PAHs can exhibit developmental problems,
   susceptibility to disease, and abnormal reproductive cycles.

   By the sheer amount of oil carried, modern oil tankers can be a threat to the environment. As discussed above,
   a VLCC tanker can carry 2 million barrels (320,000 m^3) of crude oil. This is about eight times the amount
   spilled in the widely known [616]Exxon Valdez incident. In this spill, the ship ran aground and dumped
   10,800,000 US gallons (41,000 m^3) of oil into the ocean in March 1989. Despite efforts of scientists,
   managers, and volunteers over 400,000 [617]seabirds, about 1,000 [618]sea otters, and immense numbers of fish
   were killed.^[619][114] Considering the volume of oil carried by sea, however, tanker owners' organisations
   often argue that the industry's safety record is excellent, with only a tiny fraction of a percentage of oil
   cargoes carried ever being spilled. The [620]International Association of Independent Tanker Owners has
   observed that "accidental oil spills this decade have been at record low levels-one third of the previous
   decade and one tenth of the 1970s-at a time when oil transported has more than doubled since the mid 1980s."

   Oil tankers are only one source of oil spills. According to the [621]United States Coast Guard, 35.7% of the
   volume of oil spilled in the United States from 1991 to 2004 came from tank vessels (ships/barges), 27.6% from
   facilities and other non-vessels, 19.9% from non-tank vessels, and 9.3% from pipelines; 7.4% from mystery
   spills.^[622][115] Only 5% of the actual spills came from oil tankers, while 51.8% came from other kinds of
   vessels.^[623][115] The detailed statistics for 2004 shown in the table below show tank vessels responsible for
   somewhat less than 5% of the number of total spills but more than 60% of the volume. Tanker spills are much
   more rare and much more serious than spills from non-tank vessels.

   The International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation has tracked 9,351 accidental spills that have occurred
   since 1974.^[624][116] According to this study, most spills result from routine operations such as loading
   cargo, discharging cargo, and taking on fuel oil.^[625][116] 91% of the operational oil spills are small,
   resulting in less than 7 metric tons per spill.^[626][116] On the other hand, spills resulting from accidents
   like collisions, groundings, hull failures, and explosions are much larger, with 84% of these involving losses
   of over 700 metric tons.^[627][116]

   Following the Exxon Valdez spill, the United States passed the [628]Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA-90), which
   excluded single-hull tank vessels of 5,000 gross tons or more from US waters from 2010 onward, apart from those
   with a double bottom or double sides, which may be permitted to trade to the United States through 2015,
   depending on their age.^[629][117] Following the sinkings of [630]Erika (1999) and [631]Prestige (2002), the
   European Union passed its own stringent anti-pollution packages (known as Erika I, II, and III), which also
   require all tankers entering its waters to be double-hulled by 2010. The Erika packages are controversial
   because they introduced the new legal concept of "serious negligence".^[632][118]

Air pollution[[633]edit]

   Air pollution from engine operation and from cargo fires is another serious concern. Large ships are often run
   on low quality [634]fuel oils, such as [635]bunker oil, which is highly polluting and has been shown to be a
   health risk.^[636][119] Ship fires may result in the loss of the ship due to lack of specialized firefighting
   gear and techniques and fires can burn for days.
