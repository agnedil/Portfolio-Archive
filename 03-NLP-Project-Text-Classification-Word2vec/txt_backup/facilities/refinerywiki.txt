   Oil refinery or petroleum refinery is an [9]industrial process [10]plant where [11]crude oil is processed and
   refined into more useful products such as [12]petroleum naphtha, [13]gasoline, [14]diesel fuel, [15]asphalt
   base, [16]heating oil, [17]kerosene, and [18]liquefied petroleum gas.^[19][1]^[20][2] Oil refineries are
   typically large, sprawling [21]industrial complexes with extensive [22]piping running throughout, carrying
   streams of [23]fluids between large [24]chemical processing units, such as [25]distillation columns. In many
   ways, oil refineries use much of the technology of, and can be thought of, as types of [26]chemical plants. The
   crude oil feedstock has typically been processed by an [27]oil production plant. There is usually an [28]oil
   depot (tank farm) at or near an oil [29]refinery for the storage of incoming crude oil feedstock as well as
   bulk liquid products.

   An oil refinery is considered an essential part of the [30]downstream side of the [31]petroleum industry.

History[[48]edit]

   The Chinese were among the first civilizations to refine oil.^[49][3] During 512 A.D. and 518 A.D., in the late
   [50]Northern Wei Dynasty, the Chinese geographer, writer, and politician [51]Li Daoyuan introduced the process
   of refining oil into various lubricants in his famous work [52]Commentary on the Water
   Classic.^[53][4]^[54][5]^[55][6] During the first century AD, the Chinese were among the first peoples to
   refine oil for use as an energy source.^[56][7]^[57][8] During the [58]Northern Song Dynasty, a workshop called
   the "Fierce Oil Workshop", was established in the city of Kaifeng to produce refined oil for the Song military
   as a weapon. The troops would then fill the iron cans with refined oil and threw them toward the enemy troops,
   causing a fire - effectively the world's first "[59]fire bomb" The workshop was one of the world's earliest oil
   refining factories where thousands of people worked to produce Chinese oil powered weaponry.^[60][9]

Operation[[61]edit]

   [62]Crude oil is separated into fractions by [63]fractional distillation. The fractions at the top of the
   [64]fractionating column have lower [65]boiling points than the fractions at the bottom. The heavy bottom
   fractions are often [66]cracked into lighter, more useful products. All of the fractions are processed further
   in other refining units.

   Raw or unprocessed crude oil is not generally useful in industrial applications, although "light, sweet" (low
   viscosity, low [67]sulfur) crude oil has been used directly as a burner fuel to produce steam for the
   propulsion of seagoing vessels. The lighter elements, however, form explosive vapors in the fuel tanks and are
   therefore hazardous, especially in [68]warships. Instead, the hundreds of different hydrocarbon molecules in
   crude oil are separated in a refinery into components which can be used as [69]fuels, [70]lubricants, and as
   feedstocks in [71]petrochemical processes that manufacture such products as [72]plastics, [73]detergents,
   [74]solvents, [75]elastomers and [76]fibers such as [77]nylon and [78]polyesters.

   [79]Petroleum [80]fossil fuels are burned in internal combustion engines to provide power for [81]ships,
   [82]automobiles, [83]aircraft engines, [84]lawn mowers, [85]dirt bikes, and other machines. Different
   [86]boiling points allow the [87]hydrocarbons to be separated by [88]distillation. Since the lighter liquid
   products are in great demand for use in internal combustion engines, a modern refinery will convert heavy
   hydrocarbons and lighter gaseous elements into these higher value products.
   The oil refinery in [89]Haifa, Israel is capable of processing about 9 million tons (66 million barrels) of
   [90]crude oil a year. Its two [91]cooling towers are landmarks of the city's skyline.

   Oil can be used in a variety of ways because it contains hydrocarbons of varying [92]molecular masses, forms
   and lengths such as [93]paraffins, [94]aromatics, [95]naphthenes (or [96]cycloalkanes), [97]alkenes,
   [98]dienes, and [99]alkynes. While the molecules in crude oil include different atoms such as sulfur and
   nitrogen, the hydrocarbons are the most common form of molecules, which are molecules of varying lengths and
   complexity made of [100]hydrogen and [101]carbon [102]atoms, and a small number of oxygen atoms. The
   differences in the structure of these molecules account for their varying [103]physical and [104]chemical
   properties, and it is this variety that makes crude oil useful in a broad range of several applications.

   Once separated and purified of any contaminants and impurities, the fuel or lubricant can be sold without
   further processing. Smaller molecules such as [105]isobutane and [106]propylene or [107]butylenes can be
   recombined to meet specific [108]octane requirements by processes such as [109]alkylation, or more commonly,
   [110]dimerization. The octane grade of gasoline can also be improved by [111]catalytic reforming, which
   involves removing [112]hydrogen from hydrocarbons producing compounds with higher octane ratings such as
   [113]aromatics. Intermediate products such as [114]gasoils can even be reprocessed to break a heavy,
   long-chained oil into a lighter short-chained one, by various forms of [115]cracking such as [116]fluid
   catalytic cracking, [117]thermal cracking, and [118]hydrocracking. The final step in gasoline production is the
   blending of fuels with different octane ratings, [119]vapor pressures, and other properties to meet product
   specifications. Another method for reprocessing and upgrading these intermediate products (residual oils) uses
   a [120]devolatilization^[[121]permanent dead link] process to separate usable oil from the waste asphaltene
   material.

   Oil refineries are large scale plants, processing about a hundred thousand to several hundred thousand
   [122]barrels of crude oil a day. Because of the high capacity, many of the units operate [123]continuously, as
   opposed to processing in [124]batches, at [125]steady state or nearly steady state for months to years. The
   high capacity also makes [126]process optimization and [127]advanced process control very desirable.

Major products[[128]edit]

   Petroleum products are usually grouped into four categories: light distillates (LPG, gasoline, naphtha), middle
   distillates (kerosene, jet fuel, diesel), heavy distillates and residuum (heavy fuel oil, lubricating oils,
   wax, asphalt). This classification is based on the way crude oil is distilled and separated into fractions
   (called [129]distillates and [130]residuum) as in the above drawing.^[131][2]
     * [132]Liquified petroleum gas (LPG)
     * [133]Gasoline (also known as petrol)
     * [134]Naphtha
     * [135]Kerosene and related [136]jet aircraft fuels
     * [137]Diesel fuel
     * [138]Fuel oils
     * [139]Lubricating oils
     * [140]Paraffin wax
     * [141]Asphalt and [142]tar
     * [143]Petroleum coke

   Further products (see also below) include
     * [144]Sulfur
     * [145]Olefines
     * Heat and electrical energy

   Oil refineries also produce various intermediate products such as [146]hydrogen, light hydrocarbons,
   [147]reformate and [148]pyrolysis gasoline. These are not usually transported but instead are blended or
   processed further on-site. Chemical plants are thus often adjacent to oil refineries or a number of further
   chemical processes are integrated into it. For example, light hydrocarbons are [149]steam-cracked in an
   [150]ethylene plant, and the produced ethylene is polymerized to produce [151]polyethene.

   Because technical reasons and environment protection demand a very low sulfur content in all but the heaviest
   products, it is transformed to [152]hydrogen sulfide via catalytic [153]hydrodesulfurization and removed from
   the product stream via [154]amine gas treating. Using the [155]Claus process, hydrogen sulfide is afterwards
   transformed to elementary sulfur to be sold to the chemical industry. The rather large heat energy freed by
   this process is directly used in the other parts of the refinery. Often an electrical power plant is combined
   into the whole refinery process to take up the excess heat.

Common process units found in a refinery[[156]edit]

   Washington
   Main article: [160]Petroleum refining processes
     * [161]Desalter unit washes out salt from the crude oil before it enters the atmospheric distillation unit.
     * Atmospheric distillation unit distills crude oil into fractions. See [162]continuous distillation.
     * [163]Vacuum distillation unit further distills residual bottoms after atmospheric distillation.
     * Naphtha [164]hydrotreater unit uses [165]hydrogen to desulfurize naphtha from atmospheric distillation.
       Must hydrotreat the naphtha before sending to a catalytic reformer unit.
     * [166]Catalytic reformer unit is used to convert the naphtha-boiling range molecules into higher octane
       [167]reformate (reformer product). The reformate has higher content of aromatics and cyclic hydrocarbons.
       An important byproduct of a reformer is hydrogen released during the catalyst reaction. The hydrogen is
       used either in the hydrotreaters or the hydrocracker.
     * [168]Distillate hydrotreater desulfurizes distillates (such as diesel) after atmospheric distillation.
     * [169]Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) unit upgrades heavier fractions into lighter, more valuable products.
     * [170]Hydrocracker unit uses hydrogen to upgrade heavier fractions into lighter, more valuable products.
     * [171]Visbreaking unit upgrades heavy residual oils by thermally cracking them into lighter, more valuable
       reduced viscosity products.
     * [172]Merox unit treats LPG, kerosene or jet fuel by oxidizing [173]mercaptans to organic [174]disulfides.
     * Alternative processes for removing mercaptans are known, e.g. [175]doctor sweetening process and caustic
       washing.
     * [176]Coking units ([177]delayed coking, fluid coker, and flexicoker) process very heavy residual oils into
       gasoline and diesel fuel, leaving petroleum coke as a residual product.
     * [178]Alkylation unit uses [179]sulfuric acid or [180]hydrofluoric acid to produce high-octane components
       for gasoline blending.
     * [181]Dimerization unit converts [182]olefins into higher-octane gasoline blending components. For example,
       [183]butenes can be dimerized into isooctene which may subsequently be hydrogenated to form [184]isooctane.
       There are also other uses for dimerization. Gasoline produced through dimerization is highly unsaturated
       and very reactive. It tends spontaneously to form gums. For this reason the effluent from the dimerization
       need to be blended into the finished gasoline pool immediately or hydrogenated.
     * [185]Isomerization unit converts linear molecules to higher-octane branched molecules for blending into
       gasoline or feed to alkylation units.
     * [186]Steam reforming unit produces hydrogen for the hydrotreaters or hydrocracker.
     * Liquified gas storage vessels store propane and similar gaseous fuels at pressure sufficient to maintain
       them in liquid form. These are usually spherical vessels or "bullets" (i.e., horizontal vessels with
       rounded ends).
     * Storage tanks store crude oil and finished products, usually cylindrical, with some sort of vapor emission
       control and surrounded by an earthen [187]berm to contain spills.
     * [188]Amine gas treater, [189]Claus unit, and tail gas treatment convert [190]hydrogen sulfide from
       [191]hydrodesulfurization into elemental sulfur.
     * Utility units such as [192]cooling towers circulate cooling water, [193]boiler plants generates [194]steam,
       and instrument air systems include pneumatically operated [195]control valves and an [196]electrical
       substation.
     * [197]Wastewater collection and treating systems consist of [198]API separators, [199]dissolved air
       flotation (DAF) units and further treatment units such as an [200]activated sludge biotreater to make water
       suitable for reuse or for disposal.^[201][10]
     * Solvent refining units use solvent such as [202]cresol or [203]furfural to remove unwanted, mainly
       aromatics from lubricating oil stock or diesel stock.
     * Solvent dewaxing units remove the heavy waxy constituents [204]petrolatum from vacuum distillation
       products.

Flow diagram of typical refinery[[205]edit]

   The image below is a schematic [206]flow diagram of a typical oil refinery^[207][11] that depicts the various
   [208]unit processes and the flow of intermediate product streams that occurs between the inlet crude oil
   feedstock and the final end products. The [209]diagram depicts only one of the literally hundreds of different
   oil refinery configurations. The diagram also does not include any of the usual refinery facilities providing
   utilities such as steam, cooling water, and electric power as well as storage tanks for crude oil feedstock and
   for intermediate products and end products.^[210][1]^[211][12]^[212][13]^[213][14]
   Schematic flow diagram of a typical oil refinery

   There are many process configurations other than that depicted above. For example, the [214]vacuum distillation
   unit may also produce fractions that can be refined into endproducts such as: spindle oil used in the textile
   industry, light machinery oil, motor oil, and various waxes.

The crude oil distillation unit[[215]edit]

   The crude oil distillation unit (CDU) is the first processing unit in virtually all petroleum refineries. The
   CDU distills the incoming crude oil into various fractions of different boiling ranges, each of which are then
   processed further in the other refinery processing units. The CDU is often referred to as the atmospheric
   distillation unit because it operates at slightly above atmospheric pressure.^[216][1]^[217][2]^[218][15]

   Below is a schematic flow diagram of a typical crude oil distillation unit. The incoming crude oil is preheated
   by exchanging heat with some of the hot, distilled fractions and other streams. It is then desalted to remove
   inorganic salts (primarily sodium chloride).

   Following the desalter, the crude oil is further heated by exchanging heat with some of the hot, distilled
   fractions and other streams. It is then heated in a fuel-fired furnace (fired heater) to a temperature of about
   398 °C and routed into the bottom of the distillation unit.

   The cooling and condensing of the distillation tower overhead is provided partially by exchanging heat with the
   incoming crude oil and partially by either an air-cooled or water-cooled condenser. Additional heat is removed
   from the distillation column by a pumparound system as shown in the diagram below.

   As shown in the flow diagram, the overhead distillate fraction from the distillation column is naphtha. The
   fractions removed from the side of the distillation column at various points between the column top and bottom
   are called sidecuts. Each of the sidecuts (i.e., the kerosene, light gas oil and heavy gas oil) is cooled by
   exchanging heat with the incoming crude oil. All of the fractions (i.e., the overhead naphtha, the sidecuts and
   the bottom residue) are sent to intermediate storage tanks before being processed further.

Specialty end products[[219]edit]

   These require blending various feedstocks, mixing appropriate additives, providing short term storage, and
   preparation for bulk loading to trucks, barges, product ships, and railcars:
     * Gaseous fuels such as [220]propane, stored and shipped in liquid form under pressure in specialized
       railcars to distributors.
     * [221]Lubricants (produces light machine oils, [222]motor oils, and [223]greases, adding [224]viscosity
       stabilizers as required), usually shipped in bulk to an offsite packaging plant.
     * [225]Wax (paraffin), used in the packaging of [226]frozen foods, among others. May be shipped in bulk to a
       site to prepare as packaged blocks.
     * [227]Sulfur (or [228]sulfuric acid), byproducts of sulfur removal from petroleum which may have up to a
       couple percent sulfur as organic sulfur-containing compounds. Sulfur and sulfuric acid are useful
       industrial materials. Sulfuric acid is usually prepared and shipped as the acid precursor [229]oleum.
     * Bulk [230]tar shipping for offsite unit packaging for use in tar-and-gravel roofing.
     * [231]Asphalt unit. Prepares bulk asphalt for shipment.
     * [232]Petroleum coke, used in specialty carbon products or as solid fuel.
     * [233]Petrochemicals or petrochemical feedstocks, which are often sent to petro[234]chemical plants for
       further processing in a variety of ways. The petrochemicals may be [235]olefins or their precursors, or
       various types of [236]aromatic petrochemicals.

Siting/locating of petroleum refineries[[237]edit]

   A party searching for a site to construct a refinery or a chemical plant needs to consider the following
   issues:
     * The site has to be reasonably far from residential areas.
     * Infrastructure should be available for supply of raw materials and shipment of products to markets.
     * Energy to operate the plant should be available.
     * Facilities should be available for waste disposal.

   Refineries which use a large amount of steam and cooling water need to have an abundant source of water. Oil
   refineries therefore are often located nearby navigable rivers or on a sea shore, nearby a port. Such location
   also gives access to transportation by river or by sea. The advantages of transporting crude oil by pipeline
   are evident, and oil companies often transport a large volume of fuel to distribution terminals by pipeline.
   Pipeline may not be practical for products with small output, and rail cars, road tankers, and barges are used.

   Petrochemical plants and solvent manufacturing (fine fractionating) plants need spaces for further processing
   of a large volume of refinery products for further processing, or to mix chemical additives with a product at
   source rather than at blending terminals.

Safety and environmental concerns[[238]edit]

   Fire-extinguishing operations after the [239]Texas City Refinery explosion.

   The refining process releases a number of different chemicals into the [240]atmosphere (see [241]AP 42
   Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors) and a notable [242]odor normally accompanies the presence of a
   refinery. Aside from air pollution impacts there are also wastewater concerns,^[243][10] risks of
   [244]industrial accidents such as fire and explosion, and [245]noise health effects due to [246]industrial
   noise.

   Many governments worldwide have mandated restrictions on contaminants that refineries release, and most
   refineries have installed the equipment needed to comply with the requirements of the pertinent environmental
   protection regulatory agencies. In the United States, there is strong pressure to prevent the development of
   new refineries, and no major refinery has been built in the country since [247]Marathon's [248]Garyville,
   Louisiana facility in 1976. However, many existing refineries have been expanded during that time.
   Environmental restrictions and pressure to prevent construction of new refineries may have also contributed to
   rising fuel prices in the United States.^[249][16] Additionally, many refineries (more than 100 since the
   1980s) have closed due to obsolescence and/or merger activity within the industry itself.

   Environmental and safety concerns mean that oil refineries are sometimes located some distance away from major
   urban areas. Nevertheless, there are many instances where refinery operations are close to populated areas and
   pose health risks. In California's [250]Contra Costa County and [251]Solano County, a shoreline necklace of
   refineries, built in the early 20th century before this area was populated, and associated chemical plants are
   [252]adjacent to urban areas in [253]Richmond, [254]Martinez, [255]Pacheco, [256]Concord, [257]Pittsburg,
   [258]Vallejo and [259]Benicia, with occasional accidental events that require "[260]shelter in place" orders to
   the adjacent populations. A number of refineries are located in [261]Sherwood Park, Alberta, directly adjacent
   to the City of [262]Edmonton. The Edmonton metro area has a population of over 1,000,000 residents.

   [263]NIOSH criteria for [264]occupational exposure to refined petroleum solvents have been available since
   1977.^[265][17]

Corrosion problems and prevention[[266]edit]

   Refinery of [267]Slovnaft in [268]Bratislava.
   Oil refinery in Iran.

   Petroleum refineries run as efficiently as possible to reduce costs. One major factor that decreases efficiency
   is corrosion of the metallic components found throughout refining process. [269]Corrosion causes the failure of
   equipment items as well as dictating the maintenance schedule of the refinery, during which part or all of the
   refinery must be shut down. The corrosion-related direct costs in the U.S. petroleum industry as of 1996 was
   estimated as US$3.7 billion per year.^[270][18]^[271][19]

   Corrosion occurs in various forms in the refining process, such as pitting corrosion from water droplets,
   embrittlement from hydrogen, and stress corrosion cracking from sulfide attack.^[272][20] From a materials
   standpoint, carbon steel is used for upwards of 80 per cent of refinery components, which is beneficial due to
   its low cost. [273]Carbon steel is resistant to the most common forms of corrosion, particularly from
   hydrocarbon impurities at temperatures below 205 °C, but other corrosive chemicals and environments prevent its
   use everywhere. Common replacement materials are [274]low alloy steels containing [275]chromium and
   [276]molybdenum, with [277]stainless steels containing more chromium dealing with more corrosive environments.
   More expensive materials commonly used are [278]nickel, [279]titanium, and [280]copper alloys. These are
   primarily saved for the most problematic areas where extremely high temperatures and/or very corrosive
   chemicals are present.^[281][21]

   Corrosion is fought by a complex system of monitoring, preventative repairs and careful use of materials.
   Monitoring methods include both off-line checks taken during maintenance and on-line monitoring. Off-line
   checks measure corrosion after it has occurred, telling the engineer when equipment must be replaced based on
   the historical information they have collected. This is referred to as preventative management.

   On-line systems are a more modern development, and are revolutionizing the way corrosion is approached. There
   are several types of on-line corrosion monitoring technologies such as linear polarization resistance,
   [282]electrochemical noise and electrical resistance. On-Line monitoring has generally had slow reporting rates
   in the past (minutes or hours) and been limited by process conditions and sources of error but newer
   technologies can report rates up to twice per minute with much higher accuracy (referred to as real-time
   monitoring). This allows process engineers to treat corrosion as another process variable that can be optimized
   in the system. Immediate responses to process changes allow the control of corrosion mechanisms, so they can be
   minimized while also maximizing production output.^[283][22] In an ideal situation having on-line corrosion
   information that is accurate and real-time will allow conditions that cause high corrosion rates to be
   identified and reduced. This is known as predictive management.

   Materials methods include selecting the proper material for the application. In areas of minimal corrosion,
   cheap materials are preferable, but when bad corrosion can occur, more expensive but longer lasting materials
   should be used. Other materials methods come in the form of protective barriers between corrosive substances
   and the equipment metals. These can be either a lining of refractory material such as standard Portland cement
   or other special acid-resistant cements that are shot onto the inner surface of the vessel. Also available are
   thin overlays of more expensive metals that protect cheaper metal against corrosion without requiring lots of
   material.^[284][23]

History[[285]edit]

   [286]Samuel Kier established America's first oil refinery in Pittsburgh on Seventh avenue near Grant Street, in
   1853.^[287][24] Polish pharmacist and inventor [288]Ignacy Łukasiewicz established oil refinery in [289]Jasło,
   then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in [290]Poland) in 1854. The first large refinery opened at
   [291]Ploiești, [292]Romania, in 1856-1857.^[293][25] After being taken over by [294]Nazi Germany, the Ploiești
   refineries were bombed in [295]Operation Tidal Wave by the [296]Allies during the [297]Oil Campaign of World
   War II.

   Another close contender for the title of hosting the world's oldest oil refinery is [298]Salzbergen in
   [299]Lower Saxony, [300]Germany. Salzbergen's refinery was opened in 1860.

   At one point, the refinery in [301]Ras Tanura, [302]Saudi Arabia owned by [303]Saudi Aramco was claimed to be
   the largest oil refinery in the world. For most of the 20th century, the largest refinery was the [304]Abadan
   Refinery in [305]Iran. This refinery suffered extensive damage during the [306]Iran–Iraq War. On the 31
   December 2014, the world's largest refinery complex is the [307]Jamnagar Refinery Complex, consisting of two
   refineries side by side operated by [308]Reliance Industries Limited in Jamnagar, India with a combined
   production capacity of 1,240,000 barrels per day (197,000 m^3/d). [309]PDVSA's [310]Paraguaná Refinery Complex
   in [311]Paraguaná Peninsula, [312]Venezuela with a capacity of 940,000 bbl/d (149,000 m^3/d) and [313]SK
   Energy's [314]Ulsan in [315]South Korea with 840,000 bbl/d (134,000 m^3/d) are the second and third largest,
   respectively.

Oil refining in the United States[[316]edit]

   Main article: [317]Petroleum refining in the United States

   In the 19th century, refineries in the U.S. processed crude oil primarily to recover the [318]kerosene. There
   was no market for the more volatile fraction, including gasoline, which was considered waste and was often
   dumped directly into the nearest river. The invention of the automobile shifted the demand to gasoline and
   diesel, which remain the primary refined products today. Today, national and state legislation requires
   refineries to meet stringent air and water cleanliness standards. In fact, oil companies in the U.S. perceive
   obtaining a permit to build a modern refinery to be so difficult and costly that no new refineries were built
   (though many have been expanded) in the U.S. from 1976 until 2014, when the small Dakota Prairie Refinery in
   North Dakota is set to begin operation.^[319][26] More than half the refineries that existed in 1981 are now
   closed due to low utilization rates and accelerating mergers.^[320][27] As a result of these closures total US
   refinery capacity fell between 1981 and 1995, though the operating capacity stayed fairly constant in that time
   period at around 15,000,000 barrels per day (2,400,000 m^3/d).^[321][28] Increases in facility size and
   improvements in efficiencies have offset much of the lost physical capacity of the industry. In 1982 (the
   earliest data provided), the United States operated 301 refineries with a combined capacity of 17.9 million
   barrels (2,850,000 m^3) of crude oil each calendar day. In 2010, there were 149 operable U.S. refineries with a
   combined capacity of 17.6 million barrels (2,800,000 m^3) per calendar day.^[322][29] By 2014 the number of
   refinery had reduced to 140 but the total capacity increased to 18.02 million barrels (2,865,000 m^3) per
   calendar day. Indeed, in order to reduce operating costs and depreciation, refining is operated in less sites
   but of bigger capacity.

   In 2009 through 2010, as revenue streams in the oil business dried up and profitability of oil refineries fell
   due to lower demand for product and high reserves of supply preceding the [323]economic recession, oil
   companies began to close or sell the less profitable refineries.

Worldwide oil refining capacity[[328]edit]

   According to the Oil and Gas Journal in the world a total of 636 refineries were operated on the 31 December
   2014 for a total capacity of 87.75 million barrels (13,951,000 m^3).

   Jamnagar Refinery is the largest oil refinery. Located in [329]Gujarat, India, it is owned by [330]Reliance
   Industries.
