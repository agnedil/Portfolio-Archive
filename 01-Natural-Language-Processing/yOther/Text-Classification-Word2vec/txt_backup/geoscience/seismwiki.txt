   Seismic reflection data

   Reflection seismology (or seismic reflection) is a method of [8]exploration geophysics that uses the principles
   of [9]seismology to estimate the properties of the [10]Earth's subsurface from [11]reflected [12]seismic waves.
   The method requires a controlled [13]seismic source of energy, such as [14]dynamite or [15]Tovex blast, a
   specialized [16]air gun or a seismic vibrator, commonly known by the trademark name Vibroseis. Reflection
   seismology is similar to [17]sonar and [18]echolocation. This article is about surface seismic surveys; for
   vertical seismic profiles, see [19]VSP.

History[[49]edit]

   Seismic testing in 1940

   Reflections and refractions of seismic waves at geologic interfaces within the Earth were first observed on
   recordings of earthquake-generated seismic waves. The basic model of the Earth's deep interior is based on
   observations of earthquake-generated seismic waves transmitted through the Earth’s interior (e.g., Mohorovicic,
   1910).^[50][1] The use of human-generated seismic waves to map in detail the geology of the upper few
   kilometers of the Earth's crust followed shortly thereafter and has developed mainly due to commercial
   enterprise, particularly the petroleum industry.

   Seismic reflection exploration grew out of the [51]seismic refraction exploration method, which was used to
   find oil associated with salt domes.^[52][2] [53]Ludger Mintrop, a German mine surveyor, devised a mechanical
   seismograph in 1914 that he successfully used to detect salt domes in Germany. He applied for a German patent
   in 1919 that was issued in 1926. In 1921 he founded the company Seismos, which was hired to conduct seismic
   exploration in Texas and Mexico, resulting in the first commercial discovery of oil using the refraction
   seismic method in 1924.^[54][3] The 1924 discovery of the Orchard salt dome in Texas led to a boom in seismic
   refraction exploration along the Gulf Coast, but by 1930 the method had led to the discovery most of the
   shallow Gulf Coast salt domes, and the refraction seismic method faded.^[55][2]

   The Canadian inventor [56]Reginald Fessenden was the first to conceive of using reflected seismic waves to
   infer geology. His work was initially on the propagation of acoustic waves in water, motivated by the sinking
   of the Titanic by an iceberg in 1912. He also worked on methods of detecting [57]submarines during [58]World
   War I. He applied for the first patent on a seismic exploration method in 1914, which was issued in 1917. Due
   to the war, he was unable to follow up on the idea. [59]John Clarence Karcher discovered seismic reflections
   independently while working for the [60]United States Bureau of Standards (now the [61]National Institute of
   Standards and Technology) on methods of sound ranging to detect [62]artillery. In discussion with colleagues,
   the idea developed that these reflections could aid in exploration for [63]petroleum. With several others, many
   affiliated with the [64]University of Oklahoma, Karcher helped to form the [65]Geological Engineering Company,
   incorporated in [66]Oklahoma in April, 1920. The first field tests were conducted near [67]Oklahoma City,
   Oklahoma in 1921.

   Early reflection seismology was viewed with skepticism by many in the oil industry. An early advocate of the
   method commented:

          "As one who personally tried to introduce the method into general consulting practice, the senior writer
          can definitely recall many times when reflections were not even considered on a par with the divining
          rod, for at least that device had a background of tradition."^[68][4]

   The Geological Engineering Company folded due to a drop in the price of oil. In 1925, oil prices had rebounded,
   and Karcher helped to form [69]Geophysical Research Corporation (GRC) as part of the oil company [70]Amerada.
   In 1930, Karcher left GRC and helped to found [71]Geophysical Service Incorporated (GSI). GSI was one of the
   most successful seismic contracting companies for over 50 years and was the parent of an even more successful
   company, [72]Texas Instruments. Early GSI employee [73]Henry Salvatori left that company in 1933 to found
   another major seismic contractor, [74]Western Geophysical. Many other companies using reflection seismology in
   hydrocarbon exploration, [75]hydrology, [76]engineering studies, and other applications have been formed since
   the method was first invented. Major service companies today include [77]CGG, [78]ION Geophysical,
   [79]Petroleum Geo-Services, [80]Polarcus, [81]TGS and [82]WesternGeco. Most major oil companies also have
   actively conducted research into seismic methods as well as collected and processed seismic data using their
   own personnel and technology. Reflection seismology has also found applications in non-commercial research by
   academic and government scientists around the world.

Environmental impact[[83]edit]

   As with all human activities, seismic reflection surveys may have some [84]impact on the Earth's natural
   environment and both the hydrocarbon industry and environmental groups partake in research to investigate these
   effects.

Land[[85]edit]

   On land, conducting a seismic survey may require the building of [86]roads, for transporting equipment and
   personnel, and vegetation may need to be cleared for the deployment of equipment. If the survey is in a
   relatively undeveloped area, significant [87]habitat disturbance may occur and many governments require seismic
   companies to follow strict rules regarding destruction of the environment; for example, the use of dynamite as
   a seismic source may be disallowed. Seismic processing techniques allow for seismic lines to deviate around
   natural obstacles, or use pre-existing non-straight tracks and trails. With careful planning, this can greatly
   reduce the environmental impact of a land seismic survey. The more recent use of inertial navigation
   instruments for land survey instead of theodolites decreased the impact of seismic by allowing the winding of
   survey lines between trees.

Marine[[88]edit]

   The main environmental concern for marine seismic surveys is the potential for noise associated with the
   high-energy seismic source to disturb or injure animal life, especially [89]cetaceans such as [90]whales,
   [91]porpoises, and [92]dolphins, as these mammals use sound as their primary method of communication with one
   another.^[93][5] High-level and long-duration sound can cause physical damage, such as hearing loss, whereas
   lower-level noise can cause temporary threshold shifts in hearing, obscuring sounds that are vital to marine
   life, or behavioural disturbance.^[94][6]

   A study has shown^[95][7] that migrating [96]humpback whales will leave a minimum 3 km gap between themselves
   and an operating seismic vessel, with resting humpback whale pods with cows exhibiting increased sensitivity
   and leaving an increased gap of 7–12 km. Conversely, the study found that male humpback whales were attracted
   to a single operating airgun as they were believed to have confused the low-frequency sound with that of
   [97]whale breaching behaviour. In addition to whales, [98]sea turtles, [99]fish and [100]squid all showed alarm
   and avoidance behaviour in the presence of an approaching seismic source. It is difficult to compare reports on
   the effects of seismic survey noise on marine life because methods and units are often inadequately documented.

   The [101]gray whale will avoid its regular migratory and feeding grounds by >30 km in areas of seismic
   testing.^[[102]citation needed] Similarly the breathing of gray whales was shown to be more rapid, indicating
   discomfort and panic in the whale. It is circumstantial evidence such as this that has led researchers to
   believe that avoidance and panic might be responsible for increased whale beachings although research is
   ongoing into these questions.

   Offering another point of view, a joint paper from the International Association of Geophysical Contractors
   (IAGC) and the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (OGP) argue that the noise created by marine
   seismic surveys is comparable to natural sources of seismic noise, stating:^[103][8]

     "The sound produced during seismic surveys is comparable in magnitude to many naturally occurring and other
     man-made sound sources. Furthermore, the specific characteristics of seismic sounds and the operational
     procedures employed during seismic surveys are such that the resulting risks to marine mammals are expected
     to be exceptionally low. In fact, three decades of world-wide seismic surveying activity and a variety of
     research projects have shown no evidence which would suggest that sound from E&P seismic activities has
     resulted in any physical or auditory injury to any marine mammal species."

   [111]Seismic waves are mechanical perturbations that travel in the Earth at a speed governed by the
   [112]acoustic impedance of the medium in which they are travelling. The acoustic (or seismic) impedance, Z, is
   defined by the equation:

          

   where V is the seismic [113]wave velocity and ρ ([114]Greek [115]rho) is the [116]density of the rock.

   When a seismic wave travelling through the Earth encounters an interface between two materials with different
   acoustic impedances, some of the wave energy will [117]reflect off the interface and some will [118]refract
   through the interface. At its most basic, the seismic reflection technique consists of generating seismic waves
   and measuring the time taken for the waves to travel from the source, reflect off an interface and be detected
   by an array of receivers (or [119]geophones) at the surface.^[120][9] Knowing the travel times from the source
   to various receivers, and the velocity of the seismic waves, a geophysicist then attempts to reconstruct the
   pathways of the waves in order to build up an image of the subsurface.

   In common with other geophysical methods, reflection seismology may be seen as a type of [121]inverse problem.
   That is, given a set of data collected by [122]experimentation and the physical laws that apply to the
   experiment, the experimenter wishes to develop an [123]abstract model of the physical system being studied. In
   the case of reflection seismology, the experimental data are recorded seismograms, and the desired result is a
   model of the structure and physical properties of the Earth's crust. In common with other types of inverse
   problems, the results obtained from reflection seismology are usually not unique (more than one model
   adequately fits the data) and may be sensitive to relatively small errors in data collection, processing, or
   analysis. For these reasons, great care must be taken when interpreting the results of a reflection seismic
   survey.

The reflection experiment[[124]edit]

   The general principle of seismic reflection is to send [125]elastic waves (using an energy source such as
   [126]dynamite [127]explosion or [128]Vibroseis) into the Earth, where each layer within the Earth reflects a
   portion of the wave’s energy back and allows the rest to refract through. These reflected energy waves are
   recorded over a predetermined time period (called the record length) by receivers that detect the motion of the
   ground in which they are placed. On land, the typical receiver used is a small, portable instrument known as a
   [129]geophone, which converts ground motion into an [130]analogue electrical signal. In water, [131]hydrophones
   are used, which convert pressure changes into electrical signals. Each receiver’s response to a single shot is
   known as a “trace” and is recorded onto a [132]data storage device, then the shot location is moved along and
   the process is repeated. Typically, the recorded signals are subjected to significant amounts of [133]signal
   processing before they are ready to be interpreted and this is an area of significant active research within
   industry and academia. In general, the more complex the geology of the area under study, the more sophisticated
   are the techniques required to remove noise and increase resolution. Modern seismic reflection surveys contain
   large amount of data and so require large amounts of computer processing, often performed on
   [134]supercomputers or [135]computer clusters.^[[136]citation needed]

Reflection and transmission at normal incidence[[137]edit]

   P-wave reflects off an interface at normal incidence

   When a seismic wave encounters a boundary between two materials with different acoustic impedances, some of the
   energy in the wave will be reflected at the boundary, while some of the energy will be transmitted through the
   boundary. The [138]amplitude of the reflected wave is predicted by multiplying the amplitude of the incident
   wave by the seismic [139]reflection coefficient
   
   R , determined by the [140]impedance contrast between the two materials.

   For a wave that hits a boundary at [141]normal incidence (head-on), the expression for the reflection
   coefficient is simply

          

   where
   

   Similarly, the amplitude of the incident wave is multiplied by the [142]transmission coefficient to predict the
   amplitude of the wave transmitted through the boundary. The formula for the normal-incidence transmission
   coefficient is

          

   As the sum of the squares of amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted wave has to be equal to the square of
   amplitude of the incident wave, it is easy to show that
          
          
   By observing changes in the strength of reflectors, seismologists can infer changes in the seismic impedances.
   In turn, they use this information to infer changes in the properties of the rocks at the interface, such as
   [144]density and [145]elastic modulus.^[[146]citation needed]

Reflection and transmission at non-normal incidence[[147]edit]

   Diagram showing the mode conversions that occur when a P-wave reflects off an interface at non-normal incidence

   The situation becomes much more complicated in the case of non-normal incidence, due to mode conversion between
   [148]P-waves and [149]S-waves, and is described by the [150]Zoeppritz equations. In 1919, Karl Zoeppritz
   derived 4 equations that determine the amplitudes of [151]reflected and [152]refracted waves at a planar
   interface for an incident P-wave as a function of the angle of incidence and six independent elastic
   parameters.^[153][9] These equations have 4 unknowns and can be solved but they do not give an intuitive
   understanding for how the reflection amplitudes vary with the rock properties involved.^[154][11]

   The reflection and transmission coefficients, which govern the amplitude of each reflection, vary with angle of
   incidence and can be used to obtain information about (among many other things) the fluid content of the rock.
   Practical use of non-normal incidence phenomena, known as AVO (see [155]amplitude versus offset) has been
   facilitated by theoretical work to derive workable approximations to the [156]Zoeppritz equations and by
   advances in computer processing capacity. AVO studies attempt with some success to predict the fluid content
   (oil, gas, or water) of potential reservoirs, to lower the risk of drilling unproductive wells and to identify
   new petroleum reservoirs. The 3-term simplification of the Zoeppritz equations that is most commonly used was
   developed in 1985 and is known as the "Shuey equation". A further 2-term simplification is known as the "Shuey
   approximation", is valid for angles of incidence less than 30 degrees (usually the case in seismic surveys) and
   is given below:^[157][12]
          

   where
    
Interpretation of reflections[[158]edit]

   The time it takes for a reflection from a particular boundary to arrive at the geophone is called the travel
   time. If the seismic wave velocity in the rock is known, then the travel time may be used to estimate the depth
   to the reflector. For a simple vertically traveling wave, the travel time
   
   t from the surface to the reflector and back is called the Two-Way Time (TWT) and is given by the formula

           
   where
   
   V is the wave velocity in the rock.

   A series of apparently related reflections on several seismograms is often referred to as a reflection event.
   By correlating reflection events, a seismologist can create an estimated cross-section of the [159]geologic
   structure that generated the reflections. Interpretation of large surveys is usually performed with programs
   using high-end three-dimensional [160]computer graphics.

Sources of noise[[161]edit]

   Sources of noise on a seismic record. Top-left: air wave; top-right: head wave; bottom-left: surface wave;
   bottom-right: multiple.

   In addition to reflections off interfaces within the subsuface, there are a number of other seismic responses
   detected by receivers and are either unwanted or unneeded:

Air wave[[162]edit]

   The airwave travels directly from the source to the receiver and is an example of [163]coherent noise. It is
   easily recognizable because it travels at a speed of 330 m/s, the [164]speed of sound in air.

Ground Roll / Rayleigh wave / Scholte Wave / Surface wave[[165]edit]

   A [166]Rayleigh wave typically propagates along a free surface of a solid, but the elastic constants and
   [167]density of air are very low compared to those of rocks so the surface of the Earth is approximately a
   [168]free surface. Low velocity, low frequency and high amplitude Rayleigh waves are frequently present on a
   seismic record and can obscure signal, degrading overall data quality. They are known within the industry as
   ‘Ground Roll’ and are an example of coherent noise that can be attenuated with a carefully designed seismic
   survey.^[169][13] The [170]Scholte wave is similar to ground roll but occurs at the sea-floor (fluid/solid
   interface) and it can possibly obscure and mask deep reflections in marine seismic records.^[171][14] The
   velocity of these waves varies with wavelength, so they are said to be dispersive and the shape of the
   wavetrain varies with distance.^[172][15]

Refraction / Head wave / Conical wave[[173]edit]

   A head wave refracts at an interface, travelling along it, within the lower medium and produces oscillatory
   motion parallel to the interface. This motion causes a disturbance in the upper medium that is detected on the
   surface.^[174][9] The same phenomenon is utilised in [175]seismic refraction.

Multiple reflection[[176]edit]

   An event on the seismic record that has incurred more than one reflection is called a multiple. Multiples can
   be either short-path (peg-leg) or long-path, depending upon whether they interfere with primary reflections or
   not.^[177][16]^[178][17]

   Multiples from the bottom of a body of water (the interface of the base of water and the rock or sediment
   beneath it) and the air-water interface are common in marine seismic data, and are suppressed by [179]seismic
   processing.

Cultural noise[[180]edit]

   Cultural noise includes noise from weather effects, planes, helicopters, electrical pylons, and ships (in the
   case of marine surveys), all of which can be detected by the receivers.

Applications[[181]edit]

   Reflection seismology is used extensively in a number of fields and its applications can be categorised into
   three groups,^[182][18] each defined by their depth of investigation:
     * Near-surface applications – an application that aims to understand geology at depths of up to approximately
       1 km, typically used for [183]engineering and [184]environmental surveys, as well as [185]coal^[186][19]
       and [187]mineral exploration.^[188][20] A more recently developed application for seismic reflection is for
       [189]geothermal energy surveys,^[190][21] although the depth of investigation can be up to 2 km deep in
       this case.^[191][22]
     * [192]Hydrocarbon exploration - used by the hydrocarbon industry to provide a high resolution map of
       acoustic impedance contrasts at depths of up to 10 km within the subsurface. This can be combined with
       [193]seismic attribute analysis and other [194]exploration geophysics tools and used to help
       [195]geologists build a [196]geological model of the area of interest.
     * Crustal studies – investigation into the structure and origin of the [197]Earth's crust, through to the
       [198]Moho discontinuity and beyond, at depths of up to 100 km.

   A method similar to reflection seismology which uses [199]electromagnetic instead of elastic waves, and has a
   smaller depth of penetration, is known as [200]Ground-penetrating radar or GPR.

Hydrocarbon exploration[[201]edit]

   Reflection seismology, more commonly referred to as “seismic reflection” or abbreviated to “seismic” within the
   hydrocarbon industry, is used by petroleum geologists and geophysicists to map and interpret potential
   [202]petroleum reservoirs. The size and scale of seismic surveys has increased alongside the significant
   concurrent increases in computer power during the last 25 years. This has led the seismic industry from
   laboriously – and therefore rarely – acquiring small 3D surveys in the 1980s to now routinely acquiring
   large-scale high resolution 3D surveys. The goals and basic principles have remained the same, but the methods
   have slightly changed over the years.

   The primary environments for seismic exploration are land, the transition zone and marine:

   Land - The land environment covers almost every type of terrain that exists on Earth, each bringing its own
   logistical problems. Examples of this environment are jungle, desert, arctic tundra, forest, urban settings,
   mountain regions and savannah.

   Transition Zone (TZ) - The transition zone is considered to be the area where the land meets the sea,
   presenting unique challenges because the water is too shallow for large seismic vessels but too deep for the
   use of traditional methods of acquisition on land. Examples of this environment are river deltas, swamps and
   marshes,^[203][23] coral reefs, beach tidal areas and the surf zone. Transition zone seismic crews will often
   work on land, in the transition zone and in the shallow water marine environment on a single project in order
   to obtain a complete map of the subsurface.
   Diagram of equipment used for marine seismic surveys

   Marine - The marine zone is either in shallow water areas (water depths of less than 30 to 40 metres would
   normally be considered shallow water areas for 3D marine seismic operations) or in the deep water areas
   normally associated with the seas and oceans (such as the Gulf of Mexico).

   Seismic surveys are typically designed by [204]National oil companies and [205]International oil companies who
   hire service companies such as [206]CGG, [207]Petroleum Geo-Services and [208]WesternGeco to acquire them.
   Another company is then hired to process the data, although this can often be the same company that acquired
   the survey. Finally the finished seismic volume is delivered to the oil company so that it can be geologically
   interpreted.

Land survey acquisition[[209]edit]

   See also: [210]Vibroseis

   Receiver line on a desert land crew with recorder truck

   Land seismic surveys tend to be large entities, requiring hundreds of tons of equipment and employing anywhere
   from a few hundred to a few thousand people, deployed over vast areas for many months.^[211][24] There are a
   number of options available for a controlled seismic source in a land survey and particularly common choices
   are [212]Vibroseis and dynamite. Vibroseis is a non-impulsive source that is cheap and efficient but requires
   flat ground to operate on, making its use more difficult in undeveloped areas. The method comprises one or more
   heavy, all-terrain vehicles lowering a steel plate onto the ground, which is then vibrated with a specific
   frequency distribution and amplitude.^[213][25] It produces a low energy density, allowing it to be used in
   cities and other built-up areas where dynamite would cause significant damage, though the large weight attached
   to a Vibroseis truck can cause its own environmental damage.^[214][26] Dynamite is an impulsive source that is
   regarded as the ideal geophysical source due to it producing an almost perfect [215]impulse function but it has
   obvious environmental drawbacks. For a long time, it was the only seismic source available until weight
   dropping was introduced around 1954,^[216][27] allowing geophysicists to make a trade-off between image quality
   and environmental damage. Compared to Vibroseis, dynamite is also operationally inefficient because each source
   point needs to be drilled and the dynamite placed in the hole.

   A land seismic survey requires substantial logistical support. In addition to the day-to-day seismic operation
   itself, there must also be support for the main camp (for catering, waste management and laundry etc.), smaller
   camps (for example where the distance is too far to drive back to the main camp with vibrator trucks), vehicle
   and equipment maintenance, medical personnel and security.

   Unlike in marine seismic surveys, land geometries are not limited to narrow paths of acquisition, meaning that
   a wide range of offsets and azimuths is usually acquired and the largest challenge is increasing the rate of
   acquisition. The rate of production is obviously controlled by how fast the source (Vibroseis in this case) can
   be fired and then move on to the next source location. Attempts have been made to use multiple seismic sources
   at the same time in order to increase survey efficiency and a successful example of this technique is
   Independent Simultaneous Sweeping (ISS).^[217][28]

Marine survey acquisition (streamer)[[218]edit]

   Traditional marine seismic surveys are conducted using specially-equipped vessels that tow one or more cables
   containing a series of hydrophones at constant intervals (see diagram). The cables are known as streamers, with
   2D surveys using only 1 streamer and 3D surveys employing up to 12 or more (though 6 or 8 is more common). The
   streamers are deployed just beneath the surface of the water and are at a set distance away from the vessel.
   The seismic source, usually an airgun or an array of airguns but other sources are available, is also deployed
   beneath the water surface and is located between the vessel and the first receiver. Two identical sources are
   often used to achieve a faster rate of shooting. Marine seismic surveys generate a significant quantity of
   data,^[221][29] each streamer can be up to 6 or even 8 km long, containing hundreds of channels and the seismic
   source is typically fired every 15 or 20 seconds.

   A seismic vessel with 2 sources and towing a single streamer is known as a Narrow-Azimuth Towed Streamer (or
   NAZ or NATS). By the early 2000s, it was accepted that this type of acquisition was useful for initial
   exploration but inadequate for development and production,^[222][30] in which [223]wells had to be accurately
   positioned. This led to the development of the Multi-Azimuth Towed Streamer (MAZ) which tried to break the
   limitations of the linear acquisition pattern of a NATS survey by acquiring a combination of NATS surveys at
   different azimuths (see diagram).^[224][31] This successfully delivered increased illumination of the
   subsurface and a better signal to noise ratio.

   The seismic properties of salt poses an additional problem for marine seismic surveys, it attenuates seismic
   waves and its structure contains overhangs that are difficult to image. This led to another variation on the
   NATS survey type, the wide-azimuth towed streamer (or WAZ or WATS) and was first tested on the [225]Mad Dog
   field in 2004.^[226][32] This type of survey involved 1 vessel solely towing a set of 8 streamers and 2
   separate vessels towing seismic sources that were located at the start and end of the last receiver line (see
   diagram). This configuration was "tiled" 4 times, with the receiver vessel moving further away from the source
   vessels each time and eventually creating the effect of a survey with 4 times the number of streamers. The end
   result was a seismic dataset with a larger range of wider azimuths, delivering a breakthrough in seismic
   imaging.^[227][30] These are now the three common types of marine towed streamer seismic surveys.

Marine survey acquisition (Ocean Bottom Seismic (OBS))[[228]edit]

   Marine survey acquisition is not just limited to seismic vessels; it is also possible to lay cables of
   geophones and hydrophones on the sea bed in a similar way to how cables are used in a land seismic survey, and
   use a separate source vessel. This method was originally developed out of operational necessity in order to
   enable seismic surveys to be conducted in areas with obstructions, such as [229]production platforms, without
   having the compromise the resultant image quality.^[230][33] Ocean bottom cables (OBC) are also extensively
   used in other areas that a seismic vessel cannot be used, for example in shallow marine (water depth <300m) and
   transition zone environments, and can be deployed by [231]ROVs in deep water when [232]repeatability is valued
   (see 4D, below). Conventional OBC surveys use dual-component receivers, combining a pressure sensor
   ([233]hydrophone) and a vertical particle velocity sensor (vertical [234]geophone), but more recent
   developments have expanded the method to use four-component sensors i.e. a hydrophone and three orthogonal
   geophones. Four-component sensors have the advantage of being able to also record [235]shear waves,^[236][34]
   which do not travel through water but can still contain valuable information.

   In addition to the operational advantages, OBC also has geophysical advantages over a conventional NATS survey
   that arise from the increased fold and wider range of azimuths associated with the survey geometry.^[237][35]
   However, much like a land survey, the wider azimuths and increased fold come at a cost and the ability for
   large-scale OBC surveys is severely limited.

   In 2005, Ocean Bottom Nodes (OBN) - an extension of the OBC method that uses battery-powered cableless
   receivers placed in deep water - was first trialled over the [238]Atlantis Oil Field in a partnership between
   [239]BP and [240]Fairfield Industries.^[241][36] The placement of these nodes can be more flexible than the
   cables in OBC and they are easier to store and deploy due to their smaller size and lower weight.

Time Lapse acquisition (4D)[[242]edit]

   Time Lapse or 4D surveys are 3D seismic surveys repeated after a period of time. The 4D refers to the fourth
   dimension which in this case is time. Time Lapse surveys are acquired in order to observe reservoir changes
   during production and identify areas where there are barriers to flow that may not be detectable in
   conventional seismic. TIme Lapse surveys consist out of a baseline survey and a monitor or repeat survey,
   acquired after the field was under production. Most of these surveys have been repeated NATS surveys as they
   are cheaper to acquire and most fields historically already had a NATS baseline survey. Some of these surveys
   are collected using ocean-bottom cables because the cables can be accurately placed in their previous location
   after being removed. Better repetition of the exact source and receiver location leads to improved
   repeatability and better signal to noise ratios. A number of 4D surveys have also been set up over fields in
   which ocean bottom cables have been purchased and permanently deployed. This method can be known as Life of
   Field Seismic (LoFS) or Permanent Reservoir Monitoring (PRM).^[243][37]

   OBN has proven to be another very good way to accurately repeat a seismic acquisition. The world’s first 4D
   survey using nodes was acquired over the [244]Atlantis Oil Field in 2009, with the nodes being placed by a
   [245]ROV in a water depth of 1300-2200m to within a few meters of where they were previously placed in
   2005.^[246][38]

Seismic data processing[[247]edit]

   See also: [248]Deconvolution, [249]Seismic migration, and [250]Multidimensional seismic data processing

   There are three main processes in seismic data processing: [251]deconvolution, [252]common-midpoint (CMP)
   stacking and [253]migration.^[254][39]

   Deconvolution is a process that tries to extract the reflectivity series of the Earth, under the assumption
   that a seismic trace is just the reflectivity series of the Earth convolved with distorting filters.^[255][40]
   This process improves temporal resolution by collapsing the seismic wavelet, but it is nonunique unless further
   information is available such as well logs, or further assumptions are made. Deconvolution operations can be
   cascaded, with each individual deconvolution designed to remove a particular type of distortion.

   CMP stacking is a robust process that uses the fact that a particular location in the subsurface will have been
   sampled numerous times and at different offsets. This allows a geophysicist to construct a group of traces with
   a range of offsets that all sample the same subsurface location, known as a Common Midpoint Gather.^[256][41]
   The average amplitude is then calculated along a time sample, resulting in significantly lowering the random
   noise but also losing all valuable information about the relationship between seismic amplitude and offset.
   Less significant processes that are applied shortly before the CMP stack are [257]Normal moveout correction and
   statics correction. Unlike marine seismic data, land seismic data has to be corrected for the elevation
   differences between the shot and receiver locations. This correction is in the form of a vertical time shift to
   a flat datum and is known as a statics correction, but will need further correcting later in the processing
   sequence because the velocity of the near-surface is not accurately known. This further correction is known as
   a residual statics correction.

   Seismic migration is the process by which seismic events are geometrically re-located in either space or time
   to the location the event occurred in the subsurface rather than the location that it was recorded at the
   surface, thereby creating a more accurate image of the subsurface.

Seismic interpretation[[258]edit]

   See also: [259]Geologic modelling

   The goal of seismic interpretation is to obtain a coherent geological story from the map of processed seismic
   reflections.^[260][42] At its most simple level, seismic interpretation involves tracing and correlating along
   continuous reflectors throughout the 2D or 3D dataset and using these as the basis for the geological
   interpretation. The aim of this is to produce structural maps that reflect the spatial variation in depth of
   certain geological layers. Using these maps hydrocarbon traps can be identified and models of the subsurface
   can be created that allow volume calculations to be made. However, a seismic dataset rarely gives a picture
   clear enough to do this. This is mainly because of the vertical and horizontal seismic resolution^[261][43] but
   often noise and processing difficulties also result in a lower quality picture. Due to this, there is always a
   degree of uncertainty in a seismic interpretation and a particular dataset could have more than one solution
   that fits the data. In such a case, more data will be needed to constrain the solution, for example in the form
   of further seismic acquisition, [262]borehole logging or [263]gravity and [264]magnetic survey data. Similarly
   to the mentality of a seismic processor, a seismic interpreter is generally encouraged to be optimistic in
   order encourage further work rather than the abandonment of the survey area.^[265][44] Seismic interpretation
   is completed by both [266]geologists and [267]geophysicists, with most seismic interpreters having an
   understanding of both fields.

   In hydrocarbon exploration, the features that the interpreter is particularly trying to delineate are the parts
   that make up a [268]petroleum reservoir - the [269]source rock, the reservoir rock, the seal and [270]trap.

Seismic attribute analysis[[271]edit]

   See also: [272]Seismic attribute

   Seismic attribute analysis involves extracting or deriving a quantity from seismic data that can be analysed in
   order to enhance information that might be more subtle in a traditional seismic image, leading to a better
   [273]geological or [274]geophysical interpretation of the data.^[275][45] Examples of attributes that can be
   analysed include mean amplitude, which can lead to the delineation of [276]bright spots and [277]dim spots,
   [278]coherency and [279]amplitude versus offset. Attributes that can show the presence of hydrocarbons are
   called [280]direct hydrocarbon indicators.

Crustal studies[[281]edit]

   The use of reflection seismology in studies of [282]tectonics and the Earth's crust was pioneered in the 1970s
   by groups such as the Consortium for Continental Reflection Profiling (COCORP), who inspired deep seismic
   exploration in other countries such as BIRPS in Great Britain and ECORS in France.^[283][46] The British
   Institutions Reflection Profiling Syndicate (BIRPS) was started up as a result of oil hydrocarbon exploration
   in the North Sea. It became clear that there was a lack of understanding of the tectonic processes that had
   formed the geological structures and [284]sedimentary basins which were being explored. The effort produced
   some significant results and showed that it is possible to profile features such as [285]thrust faults that
   penetrate through the crust to the [286]upper mantle with marine seismic surveys.^[287][47]
