=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:INHALATION: IMMEDIATELY REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. KEEP PERSONS
    CALM. IF NOT BREATHING, GIVE ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION. IF BREATHING
    IS DIFFICULT, GIVE OXYGEN. CALL MD. SKIN: FLUSH WITH WATER AFTER
    EXCESSIVE C ONTACT. TREAT FOR FROSTBITE IF NECESSARY. EYES:
    IMMEDIATELY FLUSH WITH PLENTY OF WATER FOR AT LEAST 15 MINUTES.
    CALL MD. INGESTION: CALL MD IMMEDIATELY . NOT CONSIDERED A
    POTENTIAL ROUTE OF EXPO SURE. NOTE TO MD'S: BECAUSE OF A POSSIBLE
    DISTURBANCE OF CARDIAC RHYTHM, CATECHOLAMINE DRUGS, SUCH AS
    EPINEPHRINE, SHOULD BE USED WITH SPECIAL CAUTION ONLY IN SITUATIONS
    OF EMERGENCY LIFE SUPPORT.
