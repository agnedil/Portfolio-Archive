First Aid:INHALATION: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR IMMEDIATELY & HAVE PATIENT
    LIE DOWN & REMAIN QUIET. APPLY ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION IF BREATHING
    HAS STOPPED. GIVE OXYGEN IF BREATHING IS DIFFICULT. INGESTION:
    DON'T INDUC E VOMITING. GIVE LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER. DON'T
    NEUTRALIZE THE ACID. NEVER GIVE ANYTHING BY MOUTH IF UNCONSCIOUS.

    ATTENTION IN ALL CASES.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:NON-FLAMMABLE
Extinguishing Media:APPROPRIATE FOR SURROUNDING MATERIAL. USE WATER
    SPRAY TO COOL CONTAINERS EXPOSED TO FIRE. DON'T WATER INSIDE
    CONTAINERS.
Fire Fighting Procedures:EVACUATE AREA. KEEP UPWIND. WEAR FULL
    PROTECTION, SCBA. RUNOFF MAY CAUSE POLLUTION. GENERATES HEAT UPON
    WATER ADDITION W/POSSIBLE SPLATTERING. NEUTRALIZE.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:REACTS W/MOST METALS, ESPECIALLY WHEN
    DILUTE, TO GIVE FLAMMABLE, POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE HYDROGEN GAS.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:DON'T BREATHE VAPOR/MIST. AVOID
    CONTACT W/EYES/SKIN/CLOTHES. KEEP CONTAINERS CLOSED. DON'T ADD
    WATER TO CONTENTS WHILE IN CONTAINER; VIOLENT REACTION.
Other Precautions:LOOSEN TIGHT CLOSURE CAREFULLY. RELIEVE INTERNAL
    PRESSURE WHEN RECEIVED/AT LEAST WEEKLY THEREAFTER. DON'T USE
