   Natural-gas processing

   Natural-gas processing is a complex industrial process designed to clean raw natural gas by separating
   impurities and various [6]non-methane hydrocarbons and fluids to produce what is known as pipeline quality dry
   natural gas.^[7][1]

   Natural-gas processing begins at the well head. The composition of the raw natural gas extracted from producing
   wells depends on the type, depth, and location of the underground deposit and the geology of the area. Oil and
   natural gas are often found together in the same reservoir. The natural gas produced from oil wells is
   generally classified as associated-dissolved, meaning that the natural gas is associated with or dissolved in
   crude oil. Natural gas production absent any association with crude oil is classified as “non-associated.” In
   2009, 89 percent of U.S. wellhead production of natural gas was non-associated.^[8][2]

   Natural-gas processing plants purify raw [9]natural gas by removing common contaminants such as water,
   [10]carbon dioxide (CO[2]) and [11]hydrogen sulfide (H[2]S). Some of the substances which contaminate natural
   gas have economic value and are further processed or sold. A fully operational plant delivers pipeline-quality
   dry natural gas that can be used as [12]fuel by residential, commercial and industrial consumers.

Types of raw-natural-gas wells[[23]edit]

   Raw natural gas comes primarily from any one of three types of wells: crude oil wells, gas wells, and
   condensate wells.

   Natural gas that comes from crude oil wells is typically called associated gas. This gas can have existed as a
   gas cap above the crude oil in the underground formation, or could have been dissolved in the crude oil.

   Natural gas from gas wells and from condensate wells, in which there is little or no crude oil, is called
   non-associated gas. Gas wells typically produce only raw natural gas, while condensate wells produce raw
   natural gas along with other low molecular weight hydrocarbons. Those that are liquid at ambient conditions
   (i.e., [24]pentane and heavier) are called [25]natural gas condensate (sometimes also called [26]natural
   gasoline or simply condensate).

   Natural gas is called sweet gas when relatively free of [27]hydrogen sulfide; gas that does contain hydrogen
   sulfide is called [28]sour gas. Natural gas, or any other gas mixture, containing significant quantities of
   hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide or similar acidic gases, is called [29]acid gas

   Raw natural gas can also come from methane deposits in the pores of coal seams, and especially in a more
   concentrated state of [30]adsorption onto the surface of the coal itself. Such gas is referred to as coalbed
   gas or [31]coalbed methane ([32]coal seam gas in Australia). Coalbed gas has become an important source of
   energy in recent decades.

Contaminants in raw natural gas[[33]edit]

   Raw natural gas typically consists primarily of [34]methane (CH[4]), the shortest and lightest [35]hydrocarbon
   molecule. It also contains varying amounts of:
     * Heavier gaseous hydrocarbons: [36]ethane (C[2]H[6]), [37]propane (C[3]H[8]), [38]normal butane
       (n-C[4]H[10]), [39]isobutane (i-C[4]H[10]), [40]pentanes and even higher [41]molecular weight hydrocarbons.
       When processed and purified into finished by-products, all of these are collectively referred to as Natural
       Gas Liquids or NGL.
     * [42]Acid gases: [43]carbon dioxide (CO[2]), [44]hydrogen sulfide (H[2]S) and [45]mercaptans such as
       [46]methanethiol (CH[3]SH) and [47]ethanethiol (C[2]H[5]SH).
     * Other gases: [48]nitrogen (N[2]) and [49]helium (He).
     * Water: [50]water vapor and liquid water. Also dissolved salts and dissolved gases (acids).
     * Liquid hydrocarbons: perhaps some [51]natural-gas condensate (also referred to as casinghead gasoline or
       natural gasoline) and/or [52]crude oil.
     * [53]Mercury: very small amounts of mercury primarily in elemental form, but chlorides and other species are
       possibly present.^[54][3]
     * [55]Naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM): natural gas may contain [56]radon, and the
       [57]produced water may contain dissolved traces of [58]radium, which can accumulate within piping and
       processing equipment.^[[59]citation needed] This can render piping and equipment radioactive over time.

   The raw natural gas must be purified to meet the quality standards specified by the major [60]pipeline
   transmission and distribution companies. Those quality standards vary from pipeline to pipeline and are usually
   a function of a pipeline system's design and the markets that it serves. In general, the standards specify that
   the natural gas:
     * Be within a specific range of heating value (caloric value). For example, in the United States, it should
       be about 1035 ± 5% [61]BTU per cubic foot of gas at 1 atmosphere and 60°F (41 [62]MJ ± 5% per cubic metre
       of gas at 1 atmosphere and 15.6°C).
     * Be delivered at or above a specified [63]hydrocarbon dew point temperature (below which some of the
       hydrocarbons in the gas might condense at pipeline pressure forming liquid slugs that could damage the
       pipeline).
     * Dew-point adjustment serves the reduction of the concentration of water and heavy hydrocarbons in natural
       gas to such an extent that no condensation occurs during the ensuing transport in the pipelines
     * Be free of particulate solids and liquid water to prevent erosion, corrosion or other damage to the
       pipeline.
     * Be dehydrated of water vapor sufficiently to prevent the formation of methane hydrates within the gas
       processing plant or subsequently within the sales gas transmission pipeline. A typical water content
       specification in the U.S. is that gas must contain no more than seven pounds of water per million
       [64]standard cubic feet (MMSCF) of gas.^[65][4]^[66][5]
     * Contain no more than trace amounts of components such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, mercaptans, and
       nitrogen. The most common specification for hydrogen sulfide content is 0.25 grain H[2]S per 100 cubic feet
       of gas, or approximately 4 ppm. Specifications for CO[2] typically limit the content to no more than two or
       three percent.
     * Maintain mercury at less than detectable limits (approximately 0.001 [67]ppb by volume) primarily to avoid
       damaging equipment in the gas processing plant or the pipeline transmission system from mercury
       amalgamation and embrittlement of aluminum and other metals.^[68][3]^[69][6]^[70][7]

Description of a natural-gas processing plant[[71]edit]

   There are a great many ways in which to configure the various [72]unit processes used in the processing of raw
   natural gas. The [73]block flow diagram below is a generalized, typical configuration for the processing of raw
   natural gas from non-associated gas wells. It shows how raw natural gas is processed into sales gas pipelined
   to the end user markets.^[74][8]^[75][9]^[76][10]^[77][11]^[78][12] It also shows how processing of the raw
   natural gas yields these byproducts:
     * Natural-gas condensate
     * [79]Sulfur
     * Ethane
     * Natural-gas liquids (NGL): propane, butanes and C[5]+ (which is the commonly used term for pentanes plus
       higher molecular weight hydrocarbons)^[80][13]^[81][14]^[82][15]

   Raw natural gas is commonly collected from a group of adjacent wells and is first processed at that collection
   point for removal of free liquid water and natural gas condensate. The condensate is usually then transported
   to an oil refinery and the water is disposed of as wastewater.

   The raw gas is then pipelined to a gas processing plant where the initial purification is usually the removal
   of acid gases (hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide). There are many processes that are available for that
   purpose as shown in the flow diagram, but [83]amine treating is the process that was historically used.
   However, due to a range of performance and environmental constraints of the amine process, a newer technology
   based on the use of polymeric membranes to separate the carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from the natural
   gas stream has gained increasing acceptance. Membranes are attractive since no reagents are consumed.^[84][16]

   The acid gases, if present, are removed by membrane or amine treating can then be routed into a sulfur recovery
   unit which converts the hydrogen sulfide in the acid gas into either elemental sulfur or sulfuric acid. Of the
   processes available for these conversions, the [85]Claus process is by far the most well known for recovering
   elemental sulfur, whereas the conventional [86]Contact process and the WSA ([87]Wet sulfuric acid process) are
   the most used technologies for recovering [88]sulfuric acid.

   The residual gas from the Claus process is commonly called tail gas and that gas is then processed in a tail
   gas treating unit (TGTU) to recover and recycle residual sulfur-containing compounds back into the Claus unit.
   Again, as shown in the flow diagram, there are a number of processes available for treating the Claus unit tail
   gas and for that purpose a WSA process is also very suitable since it can work autothermally on tail gases.

   The next step in the gas processing plant is to remove water vapor from the gas using either the regenerable
   [89]absorption in liquid [90]triethylene glycol (TEG),^[91][5] commonly referred to as [92]glycol dehydration,
   deliquescent chloride desiccants, and or a [93]Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) unit which is regenerable
   [94]adsorption using a solid adsorbent.^[95][17] Other newer processes like [96]membranes may also be
   considered.

   Mercury is then removed by using adsorption processes (as shown in the flow diagram) such as [97]activated
   carbon or regenerable [98]molecular sieves.^[99][3]

   Although not common, nitrogen is sometimes removed and rejected using one of the three processes indicated on
   the flow diagram:
     * [100]Cryogenic process ([101]Nitrogen Rejection Unit),^[102][18] using low temperature [103]distillation.
       This process can be modified to also recover helium, if desired (see also [104]industrial gas).
     * Absorption process,^[105][19] using lean oil or a special solvent^[106][20] as the absorbent.
     * Adsorption process, using activated carbon or molecular sieves as the adsorbent. This process may have
       limited applicability because it is said to incur the loss of butanes and heavier hydrocarbons.

   The next step is to recover the natural gas liquids (NGL) for which most large, modern gas processing plants
   use another cryogenic low temperature distillation process involving expansion of the gas through a
   [107]turbo-expander followed by distillation in a demethanizing [108]fractionating column.^[109][21]^[110][22]
   Some gas processing plants use lean oil absorption process^[111][19] rather than the cryogenic turbo-expander
   process.

   The recovered NGL stream is sometimes processed through a fractionation train consisting of three distillation
   towers in series: a deethanizer, a depropanizer and a debutanizer. The overhead product from the deethanizer is
   ethane and the bottoms are fed to the depropanizer. The overhead product from the depropanizer is propane and
   the bottoms are fed to the debutanizer. The overhead product from the debutanizer is a mixture of normal and
   iso-butane, and the bottoms product is a C[5]+ mixture. The recovered streams of propane, butanes and C[5]+ may
   be "sweetened" in a [112]Merox process unit to convert undesirable mercaptans into [113]disulfides and, along
   with the recovered ethane, are the final NGL by-products from the gas processing plant. Currently, most
   cryogenic plants do not include fractionation for economic reasons, and the NGL stream is instead transported
   as a mixed product to standalone fractionation complexes located near refineries or chemical plants that use
   the components for [114]feedstock. In case laying pipeline is not possible for geographical reason,or the
   distance between source and consumer exceed 3000 km, natural gas is then transported by ship as [115]LNG
   (liquefied natural gas) and again converted into its gaseous state in the vicinity of the consumer.

   The residue gas from the NGL recovery section is the final, purified sales gas which is pipelined to the
   end-user markets. Rules and agreements are made between buyer and seller regarding the quality of the gas.
   These usually specify the maximum allowable concentration of CO[2], H[2]S and H[2]O as well as requiring the
   gas to be commercially free from objectionable odours and materials, and dust or other solid or liquid matter,
   waxes, gums and gum forming constituents, which might damage or adversely affect operation of the buyers
   equipment. When an upset occurs on the treatment plant buyers can usually refuse to accept the gas, lower the
   flow rate or re-negotiate the price.

Helium recovery[[117]edit]

   If the gas contains significant helium content, the helium may be recovered by fractional distillation. Natural
   gas may contain as much as 7% helium, and is the commercial source of the noble gas.^[118][23] For instance,
   the [119]Hugoton Gas Field in Kansas and Oklahoma in the United States contains concentrations of helium from
   0.3% to 1.9%, which is separated out as a valuable byproduct.^[120][24]

Consumption[[121]edit]

   Natural gas consumption patterns, across nations, vary based on access. Countries with large reserves tend to
   handle the raw-material natural gas more generously, while countries with scarce or lacking resources tend to
   be more economical. Despite the considerable findings, the predicted availability of the natural-gas reserves
   has hardly changed.

Applications of natural gas[[122]edit]

     * Fuel for industrial heating and [123]desiccation process
     * Fuel for the operation of public and industrial power stations
     * Household fuel for cooking, heating and providing hot water
     * Fuel for environmentally friendly compressed or liquid natural gas vehicles
     * Raw material for [124]chemical synthesis
     * Raw material for large-scale fuel production using [125]gas-to-liquid (GTL) process (e.g. to produce
       sulphur-and aromatic-free diesel with low-emission combustion)
