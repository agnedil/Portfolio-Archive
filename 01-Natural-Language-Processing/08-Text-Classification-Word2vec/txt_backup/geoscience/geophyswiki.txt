   Geophysics [9] is a subject of [10]natural science concerned with the physical processes and
   physical properties of the [11]Earth and its surrounding space environment, and the use of quantitative methods
   for their analysis. The term geophysics sometimes refers only to the geological applications: Earth's
   [12]shape; its [13]gravitational and [14]magnetic fields; its [15]internal structure and [16]composition; its
   [17]dynamics and their surface expression in [18]plate tectonics, the generation of [19]magmas, [20]volcanism
   and rock formation.^[21][1] However, modern geophysics organizations use a broader definition that includes the
   [22]water cycle including snow and ice; [23]fluid dynamics of the oceans and the [24]atmosphere;
   [25]electricity and [26]magnetism in the [27]ionosphere and [28]magnetosphere and solar-terrestrial relations;
   and analogous problems associated with the [29]Moon and other planets.^[30][1]^[31][2]^[32][3]

   Although geophysics was only recognized as a separate discipline in the 19th century, its origins date back to
   ancient times. The first magnetic compasses were made from [33]lodestones, while more modern magnetic compasses
   played an important role in the history of navigation. The first seismic instrument was built in 132 AD.
   [34]Isaac Newton applied his theory of mechanics to the tides and the [35]precession of the equinox; and
   instruments were developed to measure the Earth's shape, density and gravity field, as well as the components
   of the [36]water cycle. In the 20th century, geophysical methods were developed for remote exploration of the
   solid Earth and the ocean, and geophysics played an essential role in the development of the theory of
   [37]plate tectonics.

   Geophysics is applied to societal needs, such as [38]mineral resources, mitigation of [39]natural hazards and
   [40]environmental protection.^[41][2] In [42]Exploration Geophysics, [43]Geophysical survey data are used to
   analyze potential petroleum reservoirs and mineral deposits, locate groundwater, find archaeological relics,
   determine the thickness of glaciers and soils, and assess sites for environmental remediation.

Physical phenomena[[68]edit]

   Geophysics is a highly interdisciplinary subject, and geophysicists contribute to every area of the [69]Earth
   sciences. To provide a clearer idea of what constitutes geophysics, this section describes phenomena that are
   studied in [70]physics and how they relate to the Earth and its surroundings.

Gravity[[71]edit]

   [72]Image of globe combining color with topography.
   A map of deviations in gravity from a perfectly smooth, idealized Earth.
   Main article: [73]Gravity of Earth
   Further information: [74]Physical geodesy and [75]Gravimetry

   The [76]gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun give rise to two high tides and two low tides every lunar day,
   or every 24 hours and 50 minutes. Therefore, there is a gap of 12 hours and 25 minutes between every high tide
   and between every low tide.^[77][4]

   Gravitational forces make rocks press down on deeper rocks, increasing their density as the depth
   increases.^[78][5] Measurements of [79]gravitational acceleration and [80]gravitational potential at the
   Earth's surface and above it can be used to look for mineral deposits (see [81]gravity anomaly and
   [82]gravimetry).^[83][6] The surface gravitational field provides information on the dynamics of [84]tectonic
   plates. The [85]geopotential surface called the [86]geoid is one definition of the [87]shape of the Earth. The
   geoid would be the global mean sea level if the oceans were in equilibrium and could be extended through the
   continents (such as with very narrow canals).^[88][7]

Heat flow[[89]edit]

   Main article: [90]Geothermal gradient
   [91]Pseudocolor image in vertical profile.
   A model of [92]thermal convection in the [93]Earth's mantle. The thin red columns are [94]mantle plumes.

   The Earth is cooling, and the resulting [95]heat flow generates the Earth's magnetic field through the
   [96]geodynamo and [97]plate tectonics through [98]mantle convection.^[99][8] The main sources of heat are the
   primordial heat and [100]radioactivity, although there are also contributions from [101]phase transitions. Heat
   is mostly carried to the surface by [102]thermal convection, although there are two thermal boundary layers –
   the [103]core-mantle boundary and the [104]lithosphere – in which heat is transported by
   [105]conduction.^[106][9] Some heat is carried up from the bottom of the [107]mantle by [108]mantle plumes. The
   heat flow at the Earth's surface is about 4.2 × 10^13 W, and it is a potential source of [109]geothermal
   energy.^[110][10]

Vibrations[[111]edit]

   Main article: [112]Seismology
   [113]Deformed blocks with grids on surface.
   Illustration of the deformations of a block by body waves and surface waves (see [114]seismic wave).

   [115]Seismic waves are vibrations that travel through the Earth's interior or along its surface. The entire
   Earth can also oscillate in forms that are called [116]normal modes or [117]free oscillations of the Earth.
   Ground motions from waves or normal modes are measured using [118]seismographs. If the waves come from a
   localized source such as an earthquake or explosion, measurements at more than one location can be used to
   locate the source. The locations of earthquakes provide information on [119]plate tectonics and [120]mantle
   convection.^[121][11]^[122][12]

   Measurements of seismic waves are a source of information on the region that the waves travel through. If the
   density or composition of the rock changes suddenly, some waves are reflected. [123]Reflections can provide
   information on near-surface structure.^[124][6] Changes in the travel direction, called [125]refraction, can be
   used to infer the [126]deep structure of the Earth.^[127][12]

   Earthquakes pose a [128]risk to humans. Understanding their mechanisms, which depend on the type of earthquake
   (e.g., [129]intraplate or [130]deep focus), can lead to better estimates of earthquake risk and improvements in
   [131]earthquake engineering.^[132][13]

Electricity[[133]edit]

   Although we mainly notice electricity during [134]thunderstorms, there is always a downward electric field near
   the surface that averages 120 [135]volts per meter.^[136][14] Relative to the solid Earth, the atmosphere has a
   net positive charge due to bombardment by [137]cosmic rays. A current of about 1800 [138]amperes flows in the
   global circuit.^[139][14] It flows downward from the [140]ionosphere over most of the Earth and back upwards
   through thunderstorms. The flow is manifested by lightning below the clouds and [141]sprites above.

   A variety of electric methods are used in [142]geophysical survey. Some measure [143]spontaneous potential, a
   potential that arises in the ground because of man-made or natural disturbances. [144]Telluric currents flow in
   Earth and the oceans. They have two causes: [145]electromagnetic induction by the time-varying, external-origin
   [146]geomagnetic field and motion of conducting bodies (such as seawater) across the Earth's permanent magnetic
   field.^[147][15] The distribution of telluric current density can be used to detect variations in
   [148]electrical resistivity of underground structures. Geophysicists can also provide the electric current
   themselves (see [149]induced polarization and [150]electrical resistivity tomography).

Electromagnetic waves[[151]edit]

   [152]Electromagnetic waves occur in the [153]ionosphere and [154]magnetosphere as well as the Earth's
   [155]outer core. [156]Dawn chorus is believed to be caused by high-energy electrons that get caught in the
   [157]Van Allen radiation belt. [158]Whistlers are produced by [159]lightning strikes. [160]Hiss may be
   generated by both. Electromagnetic waves may also be generated by earthquakes (see
   [161]seismo-electromagnetics).

   In the Earth's [162]outer core, electric currents in the highly conductive liquid iron create magnetic fields
   by [163]electromagnetic induction (see [164]geodynamo). [165]Alfvén waves are [166]magnetohydrodynamic waves in
   the [167]magnetosphere or the Earth's core. In the core, they probably have little observable effect on the
   [168]geomagnetic field, but slower waves such as magnetic [169]Rossby waves may be one source of
   [170]geomagnetic secular variation.^[171][16]

   Electromagnetic methods that are used for [172]geophysical survey include [173]transient electromagnetics and
   [174]magnetotellurics.

Magnetism[[175]edit]

   Further information: [176]Earth's magnetic field, [177]Aeromagnetic survey, and [178]Paleomagnetism

   The [179]Earth's magnetic field protects the Earth from the deadly [180]solar wind and has long been used for
   navigation. It originates in the fluid motions of the [181]Earth's outer core (see [182]geodynamo).^[183][16]
   The magnetic field in the upper atmosphere gives rise to the [184]auroras.^[185][17]
   [186]Diagram with field lines, axes and magnet lines.
   Earth's dipole axis (pink line) is tilted away from the rotational axis (blue line).

   The Earth's field is roughly like a tilted [187]dipole, but it changes over time (a phenomenon called
   [188]geomagnetic secular variation). Mostly the [189]geomagnetic pole stays near the [190]geographic pole, but
   at random intervals averaging 440,000 to a million years or so, the polarity of the Earth's field reverses.
   These [191]geomagnetic reversals, analyzed within a [192]Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale, contain 184 polarity
   intervals in the last 83 million years, with change in frequency over time, with the most recent brief complete
   reversal of the [193]Laschamp event occurring 41,000 years ago during the [194]last glacial period. Geologists
   observed [195]geomagnetic reversal recorded in volcanic rocks, through [196]magnetostratigraphy correlation
   (see [197]natural remanent magnetization) and their signature can be seen as parallel linear magnetic anomaly
   stripes on the seafloor. These stripes provide quantitative information on [198]seafloor spreading, a part of
   [199]plate tectonics. They are the basis of [200]magnetostratigraphy, which correlates magnetic reversals with
   other stratigraphies to construct geologic time scales.^[201][18] In addition, the [202]magnetization in rocks
   can be used to measure the motion of continents.^[203][16]

Radioactivity[[204]edit]

   Further information: [205]Radiometric dating
   [206]Diagram with compound balls representing nuclei and arrows.
   Example of a radioactive decay chain (see [207]Radiometric dating).

   [208]Radioactive decay accounts for about 80% of the Earth's [209]internal heat, powering the [210]geodynamo
   and [211]plate tectonics.^[212][19] The main heat-producing [213]isotopes are [214]potassium-40,
   [215]uranium-238, uranium-235, and [216]thorium-232.^[217][20] Radioactive elements are used for
   [218]radiometric dating, the primary method for establishing an absolute time scale in [219]geochronology.
   Unstable [220]isotopes decay at predictable rates, and the decay rates of different isotopes cover several
   orders of magnitude, so radioactive decay can be used to accurately date both recent events and events in past
   [221]geologic eras.^[222][21] Radiometric mapping using ground and airborne [223]gamma spectrometry can be used
   to map the concentration and distribution of radioisotopes near the Earth's surface, which is useful for
   mapping lithology and alteration.^[224][22]^[225][23]

Fluid dynamics[[226]edit]

   Main article: [227]Geophysical fluid dynamics

   [228]Fluid motions occur in the [229]magnetosphere, [230]atmosphere, ocean, [231]mantle and [232]core. Even the
   mantle, though it has an enormous [233]viscosity, flows like a fluid over long time intervals (see
   [234]geodynamics). This flow is reflected in phenomena such as [235]isostasy, [236]post-glacial rebound and
   [237]mantle plumes. The mantle flow drives [238]plate tectonics and the flow in the Earth's core drives the
   [239]geodynamo.^[240][16]

   Geophysical fluid dynamics is a primary tool in [241]physical oceanography and [242]meteorology. The rotation
   of the Earth has profound effects on the Earth's fluid dynamics, often due to the [243]Coriolis effect. In the
   [244]atmosphere it gives rise to large-scale patterns like [245]Rossby waves and determines the basic
   circulation patterns of storms. In the ocean they drive large-scale circulation patterns as well as [246]Kelvin
   waves and [247]Ekman spirals at the ocean surface.^[248][24] In the Earth's core, the circulation of the molten
   iron is structured by [249]Taylor columns.^[250][16]

   Waves and other phenomena in the [251]magnetosphere can be modeled using [252]magnetohydrodynamics.

Mineral physics[[253]edit]

   Further information: [254]Mineral physics

   The physical properties of minerals must be understood to infer the composition of the Earth's interior from
   [255]seismology, the [256]geothermal gradient and other sources of information. Mineral physicists study the
   [257]elastic properties of minerals; their high-pressure [258]phase diagrams, melting points and [259]equations
   of state at high pressure; and the [260]rheological properties of rocks, or their ability to flow. Deformation
   of rocks by [261]creep make flow possible, although over short times the rocks are brittle. The [262]viscosity
   of rocks is affected by temperature and pressure, and in turn determines the rates at which tectonic plates
   move (see [263]geodynamics).^[264][5]

   Water is a very complex substance and its unique properties are essential for life.^[265][25] Its physical
   properties shape the [266]hydrosphere and are an essential part of the [267]water cycle and [268]climate. Its
   thermodynamic properties determine [269]evaporation and the thermal gradient in the atmosphere. The many types
   of [270]precipitation involve a complex mixture of processes such as [271]coalescence, [272]supercooling and
   [273]supersaturation.^[274][26] Some precipitated water becomes [275]groundwater, and groundwater flow includes
   phenomena such as [276]percolation, while the [277]conductivity of water makes electrical and electromagnetic
   methods useful for tracking groundwater flow. Physical properties of water such as [278]salinity have a large
   effect on its motion in the oceans.^[279][24]

   The many phases of ice form the [280]cryosphere and come in forms like [281]ice sheets, [282]glaciers, [283]sea
   ice, freshwater ice, snow, and frozen ground (or [284]permafrost).^[285][27]

Regions of the Earth[[286]edit]

Size and form of the Earth[[287]edit]

   Main article: [288]Figure of the Earth

   The Earth is roughly spherical, but it bulges towards the [289]Equator, so it is roughly in the shape of an
   ellipsoid (see [290]Earth ellipsoid). This bulge is due to its rotation and is nearly consistent with an Earth
   in [291]hydrostatic equilibrium. The detailed shape of the Earth, however, is also affected by the distribution
   of [292]continents and [293]ocean basins, and to some extent by the dynamics of the plates.^[294][7]

Structure of the interior[[295]edit]

   Main article: [296]Structure of the Earth
   [297]Diagram with concentric shells and curved paths.
   Seismic velocities and boundaries in the interior of the [298]Earth sampled by seismic waves.

   Evidence from [299]seismology, heat flow at the surface, and [300]mineral physics is combined with the Earth's
   mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature,
   pressure. For example, the Earth's mean [301]specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific
   gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by
   its low [302]moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R^2, compared to 0.4 M R^2 for a sphere of constant density). However,
   some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of
   pressure can be calculated using the [303]Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone
   cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of
   iron and other minerals.^[304][5]

   Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no [305]S-waves in the
   [306]outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The
   [307]outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field (see
   [308]geodynamo). The [309]inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.^[310][7]

   Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic
   velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: [311]inner core, [312]outer core, [313]mantle,
   [314]lithosphere and [315]crust. The [316]mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone,
   lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the [317]Mohorovičić discontinuity.^[318][7]

   The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model
   of the Earth, [319]mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The
   mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the [320]geotherm must also be determined. This requires
   physical theory for [321]thermal conduction and [322]convection and the heat contribution of [323]radioactive
   elements. The main model for the radial structure of the interior of the Earth is the [324]preliminary
   reference Earth model (PREM). Some parts of this model have been updated by recent findings in mineral physics
   (see [325]post-perovskite) and supplemented by [326]seismic tomography. The mantle is mainly composed of
   [327]silicates, and the boundaries between layers of the mantle are consistent with [328]phase
   transitions.^[329][5]

   The mantle acts as a solid for seismic waves, but under high pressures and temperatures it deforms so that over
   millions of years it acts like a liquid. This makes [330]plate tectonics possible. [331]Geodynamics is the
   study of the fluid flow in the mantle and core.

Magnetosphere[[332]edit]

   Main article: [333]Magnetosphere
   [334]Diagram with colored surfaces and lines.
   Schematic of Earth's magnetosphere. The [335]solar wind flows from left to right.

   If a planet's [336]magnetic field is strong enough, its interaction with the solar wind forms a
   [337]magnetosphere. Early [338]space probes mapped out the gross dimensions of the [339]Earth's magnetic field,
   which extends about 10 [340]Earth radii towards the Sun. The solar wind, a stream of charged particles, streams
   out and around the terrestrial magnetic field, and continues behind the [341]magnetic tail, hundreds of Earth
   radii downstream. Inside the magnetosphere, there are relatively dense regions of solar wind particles called
   the [342]Van Allen radiation belts.^[343][17]

Methods[[344]edit]

Geodesy[[345]edit]

   Main article: [346]Geodesy

   Geophysical measurements are generally at a particular time and place. Accurate measurements of position, along
   with earth deformation and gravity, are the province of [347]geodesy. While geodesy and geophysics are separate
   fields, the two are so closely connected that many scientific organizations such as the [348]American
   Geophysical Union, the [349]Canadian Geophysical Union and the [350]International Union of Geodesy and
   Geophysics encompass both.^[351][28]

   Absolute positions are most frequently determined using the [352]global positioning system (GPS). A
   three-dimensional position is calculated using messages from four or more visible satellites and referred to
   the [353]1980 Geodetic Reference System. An alternative, [354]optical astronomy, combines astronomical
   coordinates and the local gravity vector to get geodetic coordinates. This method only provides the position in
   two coordinates and is more difficult to use than GPS. However, it is useful for measuring motions of the Earth
   such as [355]nutation and [356]Chandler wobble. Relative positions of two or more points can be determined
   using [357]very-long-baseline interferometry.^[358][28]^[359][29]^[360][30]

   Gravity measurements became part of geodesy because they were needed to related measurements at the surface of
   the Earth to the reference coordinate system. Gravity measurements on land can be made using [361]gravimeters
   deployed either on the surface or in helicopter flyovers. Since the 1960s, the Earth's gravity field has been
   measured by analyzing the motion of satellites. Sea level can also be measured by satellites using [362]radar
   altimetry, contributing to a more accurate [363]geoid.^[364][28] In 2002, [365]NASA launched the [366]Gravity
   Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), wherein two twin satellites map variations in Earth's gravity field by
   making measurements of the distance between the two satellites using GPS and a microwave ranging system.
   Gravity variations detected by GRACE include those caused by changes in ocean currents; runoff and ground water
   depletion; melting ice sheets and glaciers.^[367][31]

Satellites and space probes[[368]edit]

   Satellites in space have made it possible to collect data from not only the visible light region, but in other
   areas of the [369]electromagnetic spectrum. The planets can be characterized by their force fields: gravity and
   their magnetic fields, which are studied through geophysics and space physics.

   Measuring the changes in acceleration experienced by spacecraft as they orbit has allowed fine details of the
   [370]gravity fields of the planets to be mapped. For example, in the 1970s, the gravity field disturbances
   above [371]lunar maria were measured through [372]lunar orbiters, which led to the discovery of concentrations
   of mass, [373]mascons, beneath the [374]Imbrium, [375]Serenitatis, [376]Crisium, [377]Nectaris and [378]Humorum
   basins.^[379][32]

History[[380]edit]

   Main article: [381]History of geophysics

   Geophysics emerged as a separate discipline only in the 19th century, from the intersection of [382]physical
   geography, geology, [383]astronomy, [384]meteorology, and [385]physics.^[386][33]^[387][34] However, many
   geophysical phenomena – such as the [388]Earth's magnetic field and earthquakes – have been investigated since
   the [389]ancient era.

Ancient and classical eras[[390]edit]

   [391]Picture of ornate urn-like device with spouts in the shape of dragons
   Replica of [392]Zhang Heng's seismoscope, possibly the first contribution to [393]seismology.

   The magnetic compass existed in China back as far as the fourth century BC. It was used as much for [394]feng
   shui as for navigation on land. It was not until good steel needles could be forged that compasses were used
   for navigation at sea; before that, they could not retain their [395]magnetism long enough to be useful. The
   first mention of a compass in Europe was in 1190 AD.^[396][35]

   In circa 240 BC, [397]Eratosthenes of Cyrene deduced that the Earth was round and measured the
   [398]circumference of the Earth, using trigonometry and the angle of the Sun at more than one latitude in
   Egypt. He developed a system of [399]latitude and [400]longitude.^[401][36]

   Perhaps the earliest contribution to seismology was the invention of a [402]seismoscope by the prolific
   inventor [403]Zhang Heng in 132 AD.^[404][37] This instrument was designed to drop a bronze ball from the mouth
   of a dragon into the mouth of a toad. By looking at which of eight toads had the ball, one could determine the
   direction of the earthquake. It was 1571 years before the first design for a seismoscope was published in
   Europe, by [405]Jean de la Hautefeuille. It was never built.^[406][38]

Beginnings of modern science[[407]edit]

   One of the publications that marked the beginning of modern science was [408]William Gilbert's [409]De Magnete
   (1600), a report of a series of meticulous experiments in magnetism. Gilbert deduced that compasses point north
   because the Earth itself is magnetic.^[410][16]

   In 1687 [411]Isaac Newton published his [412]Principia, which not only laid the foundations for [413]classical
   mechanics and [414]gravitation but also explained a variety of geophysical phenomena such as the [415]tides and
   the [416]precession of the equinox.^[417][39]

   The first [418]seismometer, an instrument capable of keeping a continuous record of seismic activity, was built
   by [419]James Forbes in 1844.^[420][38]
