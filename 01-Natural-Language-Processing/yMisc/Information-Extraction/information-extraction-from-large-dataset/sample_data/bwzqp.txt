    CARCINOGENS.
Effects of Overexposure:EYE IRRITATION, SKIN IRRITATION, GI TRACT
    IRRITATION, ABDOMINAL PAIN, VOMITING, DIARRHEA. NOTE: THE IMMEDIATE
    FLUSHING OF THE EYES WITH WATER WILL MINIMIZE ANY IRRITATIVE
    EFFECT.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.
