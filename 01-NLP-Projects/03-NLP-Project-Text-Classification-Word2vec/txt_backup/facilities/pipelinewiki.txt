   An elevated section of the [25]Alaska Pipeline.

   Pipeline transport is the transportation of goods or material through a [26]pipe. The latest data from 2014
   gives a total of slightly less than 2,175,000 miles (3,500,000 km) of pipeline in 120 countries of the
   world.^[27][1] The United States had 65%, Russia had 8%, and Canada had 3%, thus 75% of all pipeline were in
   these three countries.^[28][1]

   Pipeline and Gas Journal's worldwide survey figures indicate that 118,623 miles (190,905 km) of pipelines are
   planned and under construction. Of these, 88,976 miles (143,193 km) represent projects in the planning and
   design phase; 29,647 miles (47,712 km) reflect pipelines in various stages of construction. Liquids and gases
   are transported in pipelines and any chemically stable substance can be sent through a pipeline.^[29][2]
   Pipelines exist for the transport of crude and refined petroleum, [30]fuels - such as oil, natural gas and
   biofuels - and other fluids including [31]sewage, [32]slurry, [33]water, and [34]beer. Pipelines are useful for
   transporting water for [35]drinking or [36]irrigation over long distances when it needs to move over [37]hills,
   or where [38]canals or [39]channels are poor choices due to considerations of [40]evaporation, [41]pollution,
   or environmental impact. [42]Pneumatic tubes using compressed air can be used to transport solid capsules.

   Oil pipelines are made from [43]steel or [44]plastic tubes which are usually buried. The oil is moved through
   the pipelines by [45]pump stations along the pipeline. Natural gas (and similar gaseous fuels) are lightly
   pressurised into liquids known as Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs). Natural gas pipelines are constructed of
   [46]carbon steel. [47]Hydrogen pipeline transport is the transportation of hydrogen through a pipe.
   [48]District heating or teleheating systems use a network of [49]insulated pipes which transport heated water,
   [50]pressurized hot water or sometimes [51]steam to the customer.

   Pipelines conveying flammable or explosive material, such as natural gas or oil, pose special safety concerns
   and there have been various [52]accidents. Pipelines can be the target of [53]vandalism, [54]sabotage, or even
   [55]terrorist attacks. In war, pipelines are often the target of military attacks.

   It is uncertain when the first [99]crude oil pipeline was built.^[100][3] Credit for the development of
   pipeline transport is disputed, with competing claims for [101]Vladimir Shukhov and the [102]Branobel company
   in the late 19th century, and the Oil Transport Association, which first constructed a 2-inch (51 mm) wrought
   iron pipeline over a 6-mile (9.7 km) track from an oil field in Pennsylvania to a railroad station in [103]Oil
   Creek, in the 1860s. Pipelines are generally the most economical way to transport large quantities of oil,
   [104]refined oil products or [105]natural gas over land.

   Natural gas (and similar gaseous fuels) are lightly pressurized into liquids knows as Natural Gas Liquids
   (NGLs). Small NGL processing facilities can be located in oil fields so the butane and propane liquid under
   light pressure of 125 pounds per square inch (860 kPa), can be shipped by rail, truck or pipeline. Propane can
   be used as a fuel in oil fields to heat various facilities used by the oil drillers or equipment and trucks
   used in the oil patch. EG: Propane will convert from a gas to a liquid under light pressure, 100 psi, give or
   take depending on temperature, and is pumped into cars and trucks at less than 125 psi (860 kPa) at retail
   stations. Pipelines and rail cars use about double that pressure to pump at 250 psi (1,700 kPa).

   The distance to ship propane to markets is much shorter, as thousands of [106]natural-gas processing plants are
   located in or near oil fields. Many [107]Bakken Basin oil companies in North Dakota, Montana, Manitoba and
   Saskatchewan gas fields separate the NGLs in the field, allowing the drillers to sell propane directly to small
   wholesalers, eliminating the large refinery control of product and prices for propane or butane.

   The most recent major pipeline to start operating in North America, is a TransCanada natural gas line going
   north across the Niagara region bridges with Marcellus shale gas from Pennsylvania and others tied in methane
   or natural gas sources, into the Canadian province of Ontario as of the fall of 2012, supplying 16 percent of
   all the natural gas used in Ontario.
   Major Russian gas pipelines to Europe in 2009

   This new US supplied natural gas displaces the natural gas formerly shipped to Ontario from western Canada in
   Alberta and Manitoba, thus dropping the government regulated pipeline shipping charges because of the
   significantly shorter distance from gas source to consumer. Compared to shipping by [108]railroad, pipelines
   have lower cost per unit and higher capacity. Pipelines are preferable to transportation by truck for a number
   of reasons. Employment on completed pipelines represents only "1% of that of the trucking industry."^[109][4]

   To avoid delays and US government regulation, many small, medium and large oil producers in North Dakota have
   decided to run an oil pipeline north to Canada to meet up with a Canadian oil pipeline shipping oil from west
   to east. This allows the Bakken Basin and Three Forks oil producers to get higher negotiated prices for their
   oil because they will not be restricted to just one wholesale market in the US. The distance from the biggest
   oil patch in North Dakota, in [110]Williston, North Dakota, is only about 85 miles or 137 kilometers to the
   Canada-US border and [111]Manitoba. [112]Mutual funds and [113]joint ventures are big investors in new oil and
   gas pipelines. In the fall of 2012, the US began exporting [114]propane to Europe, known as LPG, as wholesale
   prices there are much higher than in North America. Additionally, a pipeline is currently being constructed
   from North Dakota to Illinois, commonly known as the [115]Dakota Access Pipeline.

   As more North American pipelines are built, even more exports of LNG, propane, butane, and other natural gas
   products occur on all three US coasts. To give insight, North Dakota Bakken region's oil production has grown
   by 600% from 2007 to 2015.^[116][5] North Dakota oil companies are shipping huge amounts of oil by tanker rail
   car as they can direct the oil to the market that gives the best price, and rail cars can be used to avoid a
   congested oil pipeline to get the oil to a different pipeline in order to get the oil to market faster or to a
   different less busy oil refinery. However, pipelines provide a cheaper means to transport by volume.

   Enbridge in Canada is applying to reverse an oil pipeline going from east-to-west (Line 9) and expanding it and
   using it to ship western Canadian bitumen oil eastward.^[117][6] From a presently rated 250,000 barrels
   equivalent per day pipeline, it will be expanded to between one million to 1.3 million barrels per day. It will
   bring western oil to refineries in Ontario, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Quebec and New York by early 2014.
   New Brunswick will also refine some of this western Canadian crude and export some crude and refined oil to
   Europe from its deep water oil ULCC loading port.

   Although pipelines can be built under the sea, that process is economically and technically demanding, so the
   majority of oil at sea is transported by [118]tanker ships.

   The Enbridge [119]Sandpiper pipeline is proposed to transfer valuable oil from Western North Dakota through
   northwestern Minnesota. The pipeline will be 24-30 inches in diameter. It will carry over 300,000 barrels of
   oil a day with a volatility of 32.^[120][7]

Growth of market[[121]edit]

   Gas pipe in the dry region of Antofagasta, Chile.

   The market size for oil and gas pipeline construction experienced tremendous growth prior to the economic
   downturn in 2008. After faltering in 2009, demand for pipeline expansion and updating increased the following
   year as energy production grew.^[122][8] By 2012, almost 32,000 miles of North American pipeline were being
   planned or under construction.^[123][9]

Construction and operation[[124]edit]

   Oil pipelines are made from [125]steel or [126]plastic tubes with inner diameter typically from 4 to 48 inches
   (100 to 1,220 mm). Most pipelines are typically buried at a depth of about 3 to 6 feet (0.91 to 1.83 m). To
   protect pipes from [127]impact, [128]abrasion, and [129]corrosion, a variety of methods are used. These can
   include [130]wood lagging (wood slats), [131]concrete coating, rockshield, [132]high-density polyethylene,
   imported sand padding, and padding machines.^[133][10]

   Crude oil contains varying amounts of [134]paraffin wax and in colder climates wax buildup may occur within a
   pipeline. Often these pipelines are inspected and cleaned using [135]pigging, the practice of using devices
   known as "pigs" to perform various maintenance operations on a pipeline. The devices are also known as
   "scrapers" or "Go-devils". "Smart pigs" (also known as "intelligent" or "intelligence" pigs) are used to detect
   anomalies in the pipe such as dents, metal loss caused by corrosion, cracking or other mechanical
   damage.^[136][11] These devices are launched from pig-launcher stations and travel through the pipeline to be
   received at any other station down-stream, either cleaning wax deposits and material that may have accumulated
   inside the line or inspecting and recording the condition of the line.

   For natural gas, pipelines are constructed of carbon steel and vary in size from 2 to 60 inches (51 to
   1,524 mm) in diameter, depending on the type of pipeline. The gas is pressurized by [137]compressor stations
   and is odorless unless mixed with a [138]mercaptan odorant where required by a regulating authority.

Ammonia[[139]edit]

   The world's longest ammonia pipeline from Russia to [140]Ukraine.

   Highly toxic [141]ammonia is theoretically the most dangerous substance to be transported through long-distance
   pipelines.^[[142]citation needed] However, incidents on ammonia-transporting lines are uncommon - unlike on
   industrial ammonia-processing equipment.^[[143]citation needed] A major ammonia pipeline is the [144]Ukrainian
   Transammiak line connecting the [145]TogliattiAzot facility in Russia to the exporting [146]Black Sea-port of
   [147]Odessa.

Alcohol fuels[[148]edit]

   See also: [149]Biobutanol

   Pipelines have been used for transportation of ethanol in Brazil, and there are several ethanol pipeline
   projects in Brazil and the United States.^[150][12] The main problems related to the transport of ethanol by
   pipeline are its corrosive nature and tendency to absorb water and impurities in pipelines, which are not
   problems with oil and natural gas.^[151][12]^[152][13] Insufficient volumes and cost-effectiveness are other
   considerations limiting construction of ethanol pipelines.^[153][13]^[154][14]

Coal and ore[[155]edit]

   [156]Slurry pipelines are sometimes used to transport coal or ore from mines. The material to be transported is
   closely mixed with water before being introduced to the pipeline; at the far end, the material must be dried.
   One example is a 525-kilometre (326 mi) slurry pipeline which is planned to transport iron ore from the
   [157]Minas-Rio mine (producing 26.5 million tonnes per year) to the [158]Port of Açu in Brazil.^[159][15] An
   existing example is the 85-kilometre (53 mi) Savage River Slurry pipeline in [160]Tasmania, Australia, possibly
   the world's first when it was built in 1967. It includes a 366-metre (1,201 ft) bridge span at 167 metres
   (548 ft) above the Savage River.^[161][16]^[162][17]

Hydrogen[[163]edit]

   Main article: [164]Hydrogen pipeline transport

   [165]Hydrogen pipeline transport is a transportation of hydrogen through a [166]pipe as part of the
   [167]hydrogen infrastructure. Hydrogen pipeline transport is used to connect the point of [168]hydrogen
   production or delivery of hydrogen with the point of demand, with transport costs similar to
   [169]CNG,^[170][18] the technology is proven.^[171][19] Most [172]hydrogen is produced at the place of demand
   with every 50 to 100 miles (160 km) an industrial production facility.^[173][20] The 1938 [174]Rhine-Ruhr
   240-kilometre (150 mi) hydrogen pipeline is still in operation.^[175][21] As of 2004^[176][update], there are
   900 miles (1,400 km) of low pressure hydrogen pipelines in the US and 930 miles (1,500 km) in Europe.

Water[[177]edit]

   Main article: [178]Aqueduct (watercourse)
   The [179]Los Angeles Aqueduct in [180]Antelope Valley.

   Two millennia ago, the [181]ancient Romans made use of large [182]aqueducts to transport water from higher
   elevations by building the aqueducts in graduated segments that allowed [183]gravity to push the water along
   until it reached its destination. Hundreds of these were built throughout Europe and elsewhere, and along with
   [184]flour mills were considered the lifeline of the Roman Empire. The [185]ancient Chinese also made use of
   channels and pipe systems for public works. The famous [186]Han Dynasty court [187]eunuch [188]Zhang Rang (d.
   189 AD) once ordered the engineer Bi Lan to construct a series of square-pallet [189]chain pumps outside the
   capital city of [190]Luoyang.^[191][22] These chain pumps serviced the imperial [192]palaces and living
   quarters of the capital city as the water lifted by the chain pumps was brought in by a [193]stoneware
   [194]pipe system.^[195][22]^[196][23]

   Pipelines are useful for transporting water for [197]drinking or [198]irrigation over long distances when it
   needs to move over [199]hills, or where [200]canals or [201]channels are poor choices due to considerations of
   [202]evaporation, [203]pollution, or environmental impact.

   The 530 km (330 mi) [204]Goldfields Water Supply Scheme in [205]Western Australia using 750 mm (30 inch) pipe
   and completed in 1903 was the largest water supply scheme of its time.^[206][24]^[207][25]

   Examples of significant water pipelines in [208]South Australia are the Morgan-Whyalla pipelne (completed 1944)
   and [209]Mannum-[210]Adelaide (completed 1955) pipelines, both part of the larger [211]Snowy Mountains
   scheme.^[212][26]

   There are two [213]Los Angeles, California aqueducts, the [214]Owens Valley aqueduct (completed 1913) and the
   [215]Second Los Angeles Aqueduct (completed 1970) which also include extensive use of pipelines.

   The [216]Great Manmade River of Libya supplies 3,680,000 cubic metres (4,810,000 cu yd) of water each day to
   Tripoli, Benghazi, Sirte, and several other cities in Libya. The pipeline is over 2,800 kilometres (1,700 mi)
   long, and is connected to wells tapping an aquifer over 500 metres (1,600 ft) underground.^[217][27]

Other systems[[218]edit]

District heating[[219]edit]

   District heating pipeline in Austria with a length of 31 km ^[220][28]
   Main article: [221]District heating

   District heating or teleheating systems consist of a network of [222]insulated feed and return pipes which
   transport heated water, [223]pressurized hot water or sometimes [224]steam to the customer. While steam is
   hottest and may be used in [225]industrial processes due to its higher temperature, it is less [226]efficient
   to produce and transport due to greater heat losses. Heat transfer oils are generally not used for economic and
   ecological reasons. The typical annual loss of thermal energy through distribution is around 10%, as seen in
   Norway's district heating network.^[227][29]

   District heating pipelines are normally installed underground, with some exceptions. Within the system,
   [228]heat storage may be installed to even out peak load demands. Heat is transferred into the [229]central
   heating of the dwellings through [230]heat exchangers at [231]heat substations, without mixing of the fluids in
   either system.

Beer[[232]edit]

   [233]Thor Pipeline in Randers, Denmark
   Thor Pipeline in [234]Randers, Denmark

   Bars in the [235]Veltins-Arena, a major [236]football ground in [237]Gelsenkirchen, Germany, are interconnected
   by a 5-kilometre (3.1 mi) long beer pipeline. In [238]Randers city in Denmark, the so-called Thor Beer pipeline
   was operated. Originally, copper pipes ran directly from the brewery, but when the brewery moved out of the
   city in the 1990s, Thor Beer replaced it with a giant tank.

   A three-kilometer beer pipeline was completed in [239]Bruges, Belgium in September 2016 to reduce truck traffic
   on the city streets.^[240][30]

Brine[[241]edit]

   The village of [242]Hallstatt in Austria, which is known for its long history of [243]salt mining, claims to
   contain "the oldest industrial pipeline in the world", dating back to 1595.^[244][31] It was constructed from
   13,000 hollowed-out tree [245]trunks to transport [246]brine 40 kilometres (25 mi) from Hallstatt to
   [247]Ebensee.^[248][32]

Milk[[249]edit]

   Between 1978 and 1994, a 15 km milk pipeline ran between the [250]Dutch island of [251]Ameland and [252]Holwerd
   on the mainland, of which 8 km beneath the [253]Wadden Sea. Every day, 30.000 litres of milk produced on the
   island were transported to be processed on the mainland. In 1994, the milk transport was abandoned.^[254][33]

Marine pipelines[[255]edit]

   Main article: [256]Submarine pipeline

   In places, a pipeline may have to cross water expanses, such as small seas, straits and rivers.^[257][34] In
   many instances, they lie entirely on the seabed. These pipelines are referred to as "marine" pipelines (also,
   "submarine" or "offshore" pipelines). They are used primarily to carry oil or gas, but transportation of water
   is also important.^[258][34] In offshore projects, a distinction is made between a "flowline" and a
   pipeline.^[259][34]^[260][35]^[261][36] The former is an intrafield pipeline, in the sense that it is used to
   connect subsea [262]wellheads, manifolds and the [263]platform within a particular development field. The
   latter, sometimes referred to as an "export pipeline", is used to bring the resource to shore.^[264][35] The
   construction and maintenance of marine pipelines imply logistical challenges that are different from those
   onland, mainly because of wave and current dynamics, along with other [265]geohazards.

Functions[[266]edit]

   In general, pipelines can be classified in three categories depending on purpose:

   Gathering pipelines
          Group of smaller interconnected pipelines forming complex networks with the purpose of bringing crude
          oil or natural gas from several nearby wells to a treatment plant or processing facility. In this group,
          pipelines are usually short- a couple hundred metres- and with small diameters. Sub-sea pipelines for
          collecting product from deep water production platforms are also considered gathering systems.

   Transportation pipelines
          Mainly long pipes with large diameters, moving products (oil, gas, refined products) between cities,
          countries and even continents. These transportation networks include several compressor stations in gas
          lines or pump stations for crude and multi-products pipelines.

   Distribution pipelines
          Composed of several interconnected pipelines with small diameters, used to take the products to the
          final consumer. Feeder lines to distribute gas to homes and businesses downstream. Pipelines at
          terminals for distributing products to tanks and storage facilities are included in this groups.

Development and planning[[267]edit]

   When a pipeline is built, the construction project not only covers the [268]civil engineering work to lay the
   pipeline and build the pump/compressor stations, it also has to cover all the work related to the installation
   of the field devices that will support remote operation.

   The pipeline is routed along what is known as a "right of way". Pipelines are generally developed and built
   using the following stages:
    1. Open season to determine market interest: Potential customers are given the chance to sign up for part of
       the new pipeline's capacity rights.
    2. Route (right of way) selection
    3. Pipeline design: The pipeline project may take a number of forms, including the construction of a new
       pipeline, conversion of existing pipeline from one fuel type to another, or improvements to facilities on a
       current pipeline route.
    4. Obtaining approval: Once the design is finalized and the first pipeline customers have purchased their
       share of capacity, the project must be approved by the relevant regulatory agencies.
    5. Surveying the route
    6. Clearing the route
    7. Trenching - Main Route and Crossings (roads, rail, other pipes, etc.)
    8. Installing the pipe
    9. Installing valves, intersections, etc.
   10. Covering the pipe and trench
   11. Testing: Once construction is completed, the new pipeline is subjected to tests to ensure its structural
       integrity. These may include hydrostatic testing and line packing.^[269][37]

   Russia has "Pipeline Troops" as part of the [270]Rear Services, who are trained to build and repair pipelines.
   Russia is the only country to have Pipeline Troops.^[271][38]

Operation[[272]edit]

   Field devices are instrumentation, data gathering units and communication systems. The field
   [273]Instrumentation includes flow, pressure and temperature gauges/transmitters, and other devices to measure
   the relevant data required. These instruments are installed along the pipeline on some specific locations, such
   as injection or delivery stations, pump stations (liquid pipelines) or compressor stations (gas pipelines), and
   block valve stations.

   The information measured by these field instruments is then gathered in local [274]Remote Terminal Units (RTU)
   that transfer the field data to a central location in real time using communication systems, such as satellite
   channels, microwave links, or cellular phone connections.

   Pipelines are controlled and operated remotely, from what is usually known as the "Main Control Room". In this
   center, all the data related to field measurement is consolidated in one central database. The data is received
   from multiple RTUs along the pipeline. It is common to find RTUs installed at every station along the pipeline.
   The SCADA System for pipelines.

   The [275]SCADA system at the Main Control Room receives all the field data and presents it to the pipeline
   operator through a set of screens or [276]Human Machine Interface, showing the operational conditions of the
   pipeline. The operator can monitor the hydraulic conditions of the line, as well as send operational commands
   (open/close valves, turn on/off compressors or pumps, change setpoints, etc.) through the SCADA system to the
   field.

   To optimize and secure the operation of these assets, some pipeline companies are using what is called
   "Advanced Pipeline Applications", which are software tools installed on top of the SCADA system, that provide
   extended functionality to perform leak detection, leak location, batch tracking (liquid lines), pig tracking,
   composition tracking, predictive modeling, look ahead modeling, and operator training.

Technology[[277]edit]

Components[[278]edit]

   The Trans Alaska Pipeline crossing under the [279]Tanana River and over ridge of the [280]Alaska Range

   Pipeline networks are composed of several pieces of equipment that operate together to move products from
   location to location. The main elements of a pipeline system are:

   Initial injection station
          Known also as "supply" or "inlet" station, is the beginning of the system, where the product is injected
          into the line. Storage facilities, pumps or compressors are usually located at these locations.

   Compressor/pump stations
          [281]Pumps for liquid pipelines and [282]compressors for gas pipelines, are located along the line to
          move the product through the pipeline. The location of these stations is defined by the topography of
          the terrain, the type of product being transported, or operational conditions of the network.

   Partial delivery station
          Known also as "intermediate stations", these facilities allow the pipeline operator to deliver part of
          the product being transported.

   Block valve station
          These are the first line of protection for pipelines. With these valves the operator can isolate any
          segment of the line for maintenance work or isolate a rupture or leak. Block valve stations are usually
          located every 20 to 30 miles (48 km), depending on the type of pipeline. Even though it is not a design
          rule, it is a very usual practice in liquid pipelines. The location of these stations depends
          exclusively on the nature of the product being transported, the trajectory of the pipeline and/or the
          operational conditions of the line.

   Regulator station
          This is a special type of valve station, where the operator can release some of the pressure from the
          line. Regulators are usually located at the downhill side of a peak.

   Final delivery station
          Known also as "outlet" stations or terminals, this is where the product will be distributed to the
          consumer. It could be a tank terminal for liquid pipelines or a connection to a distribution network for
          gas pipelines.

Leak detection systems[[283]edit]

   Since oil and gas pipelines are an important asset of the economic development of almost any country, it has
   been required either by government regulations or internal policies to ensure the safety of the assets, and the
   population and environment where these pipelines run.

   Pipeline companies face government regulation, environmental constraints and social situations. Government
   regulations may define minimum staff to run the operation, operator training requirements, pipeline facilities,
   technology and applications required to ensure operational safety. For example, in the State of Washington it
   is mandatory for pipeline operators to be able to detect and locate leaks of 8 percent of maximum flow within
   fifteen minutes or less. Social factors also affect the operation of pipelines. Product theft is sometimes also
   a problem for pipeline companies. In this case, the detection levels should be under two percent of maximum
   flow, with a high expectation for location accuracy.

   Various technologies and strategies have been implemented for monitoring pipelines, from physically walking the
   lines to satellite surveillance. The most common technology to protect pipelines from occasional leaks is
   Computational Pipeline Monitoring or CPM. CPM takes information from the field related to pressures, flows, and
   temperatures to estimate the hydraulic behavior of the product being transported. Once the estimation is
   completed, the results are compared to other field references to detect the presence of an anomaly or
   unexpected situation, which may be related to a leak.

   The [284]American Petroleum Institute has published several articles related to the performance of CPM in
   liquids pipelines. The API Publications are:
     * RAM 1130 - Computational pipeline monitoring for liquids pipelines
     * API 1149 - Pipeline variable uncertainties and their effects on leak detectability

   Where a pipeline containing passes under a road or railway, it is usually enclosed in a protective casing. This
   casing is vented to the atmosphere to prevent the build-up of flammable gases or corrosive substances, and to
   allow the air inside the casing to be sampled to detect leaks. The casing vent, a pipe protruding from the
   ground, often doubles as a warning marker called a casing vent marker.^[285][39]

Implementation[[286]edit]

   Pipelines are generally laid underground because temperature is less variable. Because pipelines are usually
   metal, this helps to reduce the expansion and shrinkage that can occur with weather changes.^[287][40] However,
   in some cases it is necessary to cross a valley or a river on a [288]pipeline bridge. Pipelines for centralized
   heating systems are often laid on the ground or overhead. Pipelines for petroleum running through permafrost
   areas as Trans-Alaska-Pipeline are often run overhead in order to avoid melting the frozen ground by hot
   petroleum which would result in sinking the pipeline in the ground.

Maintenance[[289]edit]

   Maintenance of pipelines includes checking [290]cathodic protection levels for the proper range, surveillance
   for construction, erosion, or leaks by foot, land vehicle, boat, or air, and running cleaning pigs, when there
   is anything carried in the pipeline that is corrosive.

   US pipeline maintenance rules are covered in [291]Code of Federal Regulations(CFR) sections, 49 CFR 192 for
   natural gas pipelines, and 49 CFR 195 for petroleum liquid pipelines.

Regulation[[292]edit]

   An underground petroleum pipeline running through a park

   In the US, onshore and offshore pipelines used to transport oil and gas are regulated by the [293]Pipeline and
   Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). Certain offshore pipelines used to produce oil and gas are
   regulated by the [294]Minerals Management Service (MMS). In Canada, pipelines are regulated by either the
   provincial regulators or, if they cross provincial boundaries or the Canada-US border, by the [295]National
   Energy Board (NEB). Government regulations in Canada and the United States require that buried fuel pipelines
   must be protected from [296]corrosion. Often, the most economical method of corrosion control is by use of
   pipeline [297]coating in conjunction with [298]cathodic protection and technology to monitor the pipeline.
   Above ground, cathodic protection is not an option. The coating is the only external protection.

Pipelines and geopolitics[[299]edit]

   Pipelines for major energy resources (petroleum and natural gas) are not merely an element of trade. They
   connect to issues of [300]geopolitics and [301]international security as well, and the construction, placement,
   and control of oil and gas pipelines often figure prominently in [302]state interests and actions. A notable
   example of pipeline politics occurred at the beginning of the year 2009, wherein [303]a dispute between Russia
   and [304]Ukraine ostensibly over pricing led to a major political crisis. Russian state-owned gas company
   [305]Gazprom cut off natural gas supplies to Ukraine after talks between it and the Ukrainian government fell
   through. In addition to cutting off supplies to Ukraine, Russian gas flowing through Ukraine—which included
   nearly all supplies to [306]Southeastern Europe and some supplies to [307]Central and [308]Western Europe—was
   cut off, creating a major crisis in several countries heavily dependent on Russian gas as fuel. Russia was
   accused of using the dispute as leverage in its attempt to keep other powers, and particularly the
   [309]European Union, from interfering in its "[310]near abroad".

   Oil and gas pipelines also figure prominently in the politics of [311]Central Asia and the [312]Caucasus.

Hazard identification[[313]edit]

   Because the [314]solvent fraction of [315]dilbit typically comprises [316]volatile [317]aromatics like
   [318]naptha and [319]benzene, reasonably rapid carrier [320]vaporization can be expected to follow an
   above-ground spill—ostensibly enabling timely intervention by leaving only a [321]viscous residue that is slow
   to migrate. Effective protocols to minimize exposure to [322]petrochemical vapours are well-established, and
   oil spilled from the pipeline would be unlikely to reach the [323]aquifer unless incomplete remediation were
   followed by the introduction of another carrier (e.g. a series of torrential downpours).

   The introduction of [324]benzene and other volatile organic compounds (collectively [325]BTEX) to the
   subterranean environment compounds the threat posed by a pipeline leak. Particularly if followed by rain, a
   pipeline breach would result in BTEX [326]dissolution and [327]equilibration of benzene in water, followed by
   [328]percolation of the admixture into the aquifer. Benzene can cause many [329]health problems and is
   [330]carcinogenic with EPA [331]Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) set at 5 μg/L for [332]potable water.^[333][41]
   Although it is not well studied, single benzene exposure events have been linked to acute
   carcinogenesis.^[334][42] Additionally, the exposure of livestock, mainly cattle, to benzene has been shown to
   cause many health issues, such as [335]neurotoxicity, fetal damage and fatal poisoning.^[336][43]

   The entire surface of an above-ground pipeline can be directly examined for material breach. Pooled petroleum
   is unambiguous, readily spotted, and indicates the location of required repairs. Because the effectiveness of
   remote inspection is limited by the cost of monitoring equipment, gaps between [337]sensors, and data that
   requires interpretation, small leaks in buried pipe can sometimes go undetected

   Pipeline developers do not always prioritize effective surveillance against leaks. Buried pipes draw fewer
   complaints. They are [338]insulated from extremes in [339]ambient temperature, they are shielded from
   [340]ultraviolet rays, and they are less exposed to [341]photodegradation. Buried pipes are isolated from
   airborne debris, [342]electrical storms, [343]tornadoes, [344]hurricanes, [345]hail, and [346]acid rain. They
   are protected from nesting birds, [347]rutting mammals, and wayward buckshot. Buried pipe is less vulnerable to
   accident damage (e.g. [348]automobile collisions) and less accessible to [349]vandals, [350]saboteurs, and
   [351]terrorists.

Exposure[[352]edit]

   Previous work^[353][44] has shown that a 'worst-case exposure scenario' can be limited to a specific set of
   conditions. Based on the advanced detection methods and pipeline shut-off [354]SOP developed by TransCanada,
   the risk of a substantive or large release over a short period of time contaminating groundwater with benzene
   is unlikely.^[355][45] Detection, shutoff, and remediation procedures would limit the dissolution and transport
   of benzene. Therefore, the exposure of benzene would be limited to leaks that are below the [356]limit of
   detection and go unnoticed for extended periods of time.^[357][44] Leak detection is monitored through a
   [358]SCADA system that assesses pressure and volume flow every 5 seconds. A pinhole leak that releases small
   quantities that cannot be detected by the SCADA system (<1.5% flow) could accumulate into a substantive
   spill.^[359][45] Detection of pinhole leaks would come from a visual or [360]olfactory inspection, aerial
   surveying, or mass-balance inconsistencies.^[361][45] It is assumed that pinhole leaks are discovered within
   the 14-day inspection interval, however snow cover and location (e.g. remote, deep) could delay detection.
   Benzene typically makes up 0.1 - 1.0% of oil and will have varying degrees of [362]volatility and dissolution
   based on environmental factors.

   Even with pipeline leak volumes within SCADA detection limits, sometimes pipeline leaks are misinterpreted by
   pipeline operators to be pump malfunctions, or other problems. The [363]Enbridge Line 6B [364]crude oil
   pipeline failure in [365]Marshall, Michigan on July 25, 2010 was thought by operators in Edmonton to be from
   column separation of the [366]dilbit in that pipeline. The leak in wetlands along the Kalamazoo River was only
   confirmed 17 hours after it happened by a local gas company employee in Michigan.

Spill frequency-volume[[367]edit]

   Although the [368]Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has standard baseline incident
   frequencies to estimate the number of spills, TransCanada altered these assumptions based on improved pipeline
   design, operation, and safety.^[369][45] Whether these adjustments are justified is debatable as these
   assumptions resulted in a nearly 10-fold decrease in spill estimates.^[370][44] Given that the pipeline crosses
   247 miles of the Ogallala Aquifer,^[371][46] or 14.5% of the entire pipeline length, and the 50-year life of
   the entire pipeline is expected to have between 11 - 91 spills,^[372][44] approximately 1.6 - 13.2 spills can
   be expected to occur over the aquifer. An estimate of 13.2 spills over the aquifer, each lasting 14 days,
   results in 184 days of potential exposure over the 50 year lifetime of the pipeline. In the reduced scope
   'worst case exposure scenario,' the volume of a pinhole leak at 1.5% of max flow-rate for 14 days has been
   estimated at 189,000 barrels or 7.9 million gallons of oil.^[373][44] According to PHMSA's incident
   database,^[374][47] only 0.5% of all spills in the last 10 years were >10,000 barrels.

Benzene fate and transport[[375]edit]

   Scenario for benzene leaching to groundwater

   Benzene is considered a light [376]aromatic hydrocarbon with high solubility and high
   volatility.^[[377]clarification needed] It is unclear how temperature and depth would impact the volatility of
   benzene, so assumptions have been made that benzene in oil (1% weight by volume) would not volatilize before
   equilibrating with water.^[378][44] Using the octanol-water partition coefficient and a 100-year precipitation
   event for the area, a worst-case estimate of 75 mg/L of benzene is anticipated to flow toward the
   aquifer.^[379][44] The actual movement of the [380]plume through [381]groundwater systems is not well
   described, although one estimate is that up to 4.9 billion gallons of water in the Ogallala Aquifer could
   become contaminated with benzene at concentrations above the MCL.^[382][44] The Final Environmental Impact
   Statement from the State Department does not include a quantitative analysis because it assumed that most
   benzene will volatilize.^[383][45]

Previous dilbit spill remediation difficulties[[384]edit]

   One of the major concerns about [385]dilbit is the difficulty in cleaning it up.^[386][48] Enbridge's Line 6B,
   a 30-inch crude oil pipeline, ruptured in Marshall, Michigan on July 25, 2010, mentioned above, spilled at
   least 843,000 gallons of dilbit.^[387][49] After detection of the leak, booms and vacuum trucks were deployed.
   Heavy rains caused the river to overtop existing dams, and carried dilbit 30 miles downstream before the spill
   was contained. Remediation work collected over 1.1 million gallons of oil and almost 200,000 cubic yards of
   oil-contaminated sediment and debris from the Kalamazoo River system. However, oil was still being found in
   affected waters in October 2012.^[388][50]

Dangers[[389]edit]

Accidents[[390]edit]

   For a more comprehensive list, see [391]List of pipeline accidents.

   Pipelines conveying flammable or explosive material, such as natural gas or oil, pose special safety concerns.
     * 1965 - A 32-inch gas transmission pipeline, north of Natchitoches, Louisiana, belonging to the Tennessee
       Gas Pipeline exploded and burned from [392]stress corrosion cracking failure on March 4, killing 17 people.
       At least 9 others were injured, and 7 homes 450 feet from the rupture were destroyed. This accident, and
       others of the era, led then-President Lyndon B. Johnson to call for the formation of a national pipeline
       safety agency in 1967. The same pipeline had also had an explosion on May 9, 1955, just 930 feet (280 m)
       from the 1965 failure.^[393][51]^[394][52]
     * June 16, 1976 - A gasoline pipeline was ruptured by a road construction crew in [395]Los Angeles,
       California. Gasoline sprayed across the area, and soon ignited, killing 9, and injuring at least 14 others.
       Confusion over the depth of the pipeline in the construction area seemed to be a factor in the
       accident.^[396][53]
     * June 4, 1989 - The [397]Ufa train disaster: Sparks from two passing trains detonated gas leaking from a
       [398]LPG pipeline near [399]Ufa, Russia. At least 575 people were reported killed.
     * October 17, 1998 - [400]1998 Jesse pipeline explosion: A [401]petroleum pipeline exploded at Jesse on the
       [402]Niger Delta in [403]Nigeria, killing about 1,200 villagers, some of whom were scavenging
       [404]gasoline.
     * June 10, 1999 - A pipeline rupture in a [405]Bellingham, Washington park led to the release of 277,200
       gallons of gasoline. The gasoline was ignited, causing an explosion that killed two children and one adult.
       Misoperation of the pipeline and a previously damaged section of the pipe that was not detected before were
       identified as causing the failure.^[406][54]
     * August 19, 2000 - A natural gas pipeline rupture and fire near [407]Carlsbad, New Mexico; this explosion
       and fire killed 12 members of an extended family. The cause was due to severe internal corrosion of the
       pipeline.^[408][55]
     * July 30, 2004 - A major [409]natural gas pipeline exploded in [410]Ghislenghien, Belgium near [411]Ath
       (thirty kilometres southwest of [412]Brussels), killing at least 24 people and leaving 132 wounded, some
       critically.
     * May 12, 2006 - An oil pipeline ruptured outside [413]Lagos, [414]Nigeria. Up to 200 people may have been
       killed. See [415]Nigeria oil blast.
     * November 1, 2007 - A propane pipeline exploded near Carmichael, Mississippi, about 30 miles (48 km) south
       of [416]Meridian, Mississippi. Two people were killed instantly and an additional four were injured.
       Several homes were destroyed and sixty families were displaced. The pipeline is owned by Enterprise
       Products Partners LP, and runs from [417]Mont Belvieu, Texas, to [418]Apex, North Carolina. Inability to
       find flaws in pre-1971 ERW seam welded pipe flaws was a contributing factor to the
       accident.^[419][56]^[420][57]
     * September 9, 2010 - [421]2010 San Bruno pipeline explosion: A 30-inch diameter high pressure natural gas
       pipeline owned by Pacific Gas and Electric exploded in the Crestmoor residential neighborhood 2 mi (3.2 km)
       west of San Francisco International Airport, killing 8, injuring 58, and destroying 38 homes. Poor quality
       control of the pipe used and of the construction were cited as factors in the accident.^[422][58]
     * June 27, 2014 - An explosion occurred after a natural gas pipe line ruptured in Nagaram village, East
       Godavari district, [423]Andhra Pradesh, India causing 16 deaths and destroying "scores of homes".^[424][59]
     * July 31, 2014 - On the night of July 31, [425]a series of explosions originating in underground gas
       pipelines occurred in the city of [426]Kaohsiung. Leaking gas filled the sewers along several major
       thoroughfares and the resulting explosions turned several kilometers of road surface into deep trenches,
       sending vehicles and debris high into the air and igniting fires over a large area. At least 32 people were
       killed and 321 injured.^[427][60]^[428][61]

As targets[[429]edit]

   Pipelines can be the target of [430]vandalism, [431]sabotage, or even [432]terrorist attacks. In war, pipelines
   are often the target of military attacks, as destruction of pipelines can seriously disrupt enemy
   [433]logistics.
