# Topic Modeling Using the Expectation Maximization Algorithm Implemented by Hand (Manually)

Implementing the multinomial mixture of topics model without using a package for clustering.

Clustering this to 30 topics, using a simple mixture of multinomial topics model.

Building a graph showing, for each topic, the probability with which the topic is selected and producing a table showing, for each topic, the 10 words with the highest probability for that topic.
