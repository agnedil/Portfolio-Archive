# Search Engine Evaluation

Ranking search engine results using the metapy module of Python

Metapy is a Python wrapper for the MeTa toolkit. MeTA is a modern data sciences toolkit featuring:

   - text tokenization, including deep semantic features like parse trees

   - inverted and forward indexes with compression and various caching strategies

   - a collection of ranking functions for searching the indexes

   - topic models

   - classification algorithms

   - graph algorithms

   - language models

   - CRF implementation (POS-tagging, shallow parsing)

   - wrappers for liblinear and libsvm (including libsvm dataset parsers)

   - UTF8 support for analysis on various languages

   - multithreaded algorithms
