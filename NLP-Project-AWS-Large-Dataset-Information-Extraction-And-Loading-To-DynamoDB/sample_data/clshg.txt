=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:YES    IARC:YES	  OSHA:YES
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:ACUTE: INHALATION-INHALED PARTICULATE
    MAY IRRITATE THE RESPIRATORY TRACT. EXCESSIVE INHALATION OF
    ALUMINUM, COBALT, COPPER, MANGANESE, NICKEL & ZINC CAN CAUSE
    RESPIRATORY IRRITATION, COUGH, BRONCHITIS , CHILLS, "METAL FUME
    FEVER" & ASTHMA-LIKE SYMPTOMS. SKIN-SKIN CONTACT WITH THESE
    MATERIALS MAY CAUSE IRRITATION & IN SOME INDIVIDUALS AN ALLERGIC
    DERMATITIS WHEN ELEMENTS SUCH AS CHROME, COBALT & NIC KEL ARE
    PRESENT. EYES-CONTACT WITH PARTICULATE METAL MAY INFLAME THE
    CONJUNCTIVA. CHRONIC: RESPIRATORY DISEASE WITH SYMPTOMS RANGING
    FROM SHORTNESS OF BREATH & COUGH TO PERMANENT DISABILITY DUE TO LOS
    S OF LUNG FUNCTION; "SEE OTHER INFO"
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:CHROMIUM AND ITS COMPOUNDS, COBALT AND
    IS COMPOUNDS, AND NICKEL AND ITS COMPOUNDS ARE CLASSIFIED AS
    CARCINOGENS BY NTP AND.OR IARC. WELDING FUMES-OSHA REQUIRES THAT
    WELDING FUMES BE CONSIDIERED AS CAR CINOGENS BECAUSE THEY ARE
    CLASSIFIED BY IARC.
Effects of Overexposure:INGESTION OF LARGE DOSES MAY CAUSE NAUSEA,
    VOMITING, AND DIARRHEA.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE HAD A
    ALLERGIC REACTION OR SENSITIVITY TO METAL MAY ENCOUNTER SKIN RASH
    OR DERMATITIS. PERSONS WITH IMPAIRED PULMONARY FUNCTION MAY INCUR
    FUTHER DISABILITY.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:INHALATION-REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. IF BREATHING HAS STOPPED,
    PERFORM ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION & OBTAIN MEDICAL AID AT ONCE.
    INGESTION-NEVER GIVE ANYTHING BY MOUTH TO AN UNCONSCIOUS PERSON.
    CONTACT A POISON  CONTROL CENTER (PCC). UNLESS THE PCC ADVISES
    ORTHERWISE, HAVE CONSCIOUS PERSON DRINK 1-2 GLASSES OF WATER TO
    DILUTE. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING UNLESS LARGE AMOUNTS ARE INGESTED.
    OBTAIN MEDICAL AID AT ON CE. SKIN-TREAT CUTS & ABRAISIONS WITH
    STANDARD FIRST AID. IF IRRITATION OCCURS, OBTAIN MEDICAL AID.
    EYES-FLUSH DUST/POWDER FROM EYES WITH CLEAN WATER FOR 15 MINS. IF
    IRRITATION PERSISTS, OBTAIN MEDICA L AID.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:NONE
Lower Limits:NONE
Upper Limits:NONE
Extinguishing Media:THESE ALLOYS IN SOLID WROUGHT FORM ARE
    NONCOMBUSTIBLE. USE EXTINGUISHING MEDIA APPROPRIATE TO THE
    SURROUNGING FIRE.
Fire Fighting Procedures:TO EXTINGUISH A METAL POWDER FIRE USE DRY
    SAND, DRY GRAPHITE OR OTHER CLASS "D" EXTINGUISHING POWDER.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:NO UNUSUAL FIRE OR EXPLOSION HAZARDS.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:IN SOLID FORM THIS MATERIAL POSES NO SPECIAL
    CLEAN-UP PROBLEMS. IF THIS MATERIAL IS IN POWDER OR DUST FORM, DO
    NOT DRY SWEEP, NOTIFY SAFETY PERSONNEL, CLEAN-UP SHOULD BE
    CONDUCTED WITH A VACUUM SYSTEM  UTILIZING A HIGH EFFICIENCY
    PARTICULATE AIR (HEPA) FILTRATION SYSTEM.CAUTION SHOULD BE TAKEN TO
    MINIMIZE AIRBORNE GENERATION OF POWDER OR DUST AND AVOID
    CONTAMINATION OF AIR AND WATER.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:HANDLING-THIS PRODUCT MUST BE HANDLED
    ACCORDING TO THE SIZE, SHAPE AND QUANTITY OF MATERIAL INVOLVED.
    POWDERS SHOULD BE MOVE OR TRANSPORTED TO MINIMIZE SPILL OR RELEASE
    POTENTIAL. AVOID DUST INHALATIO N AND EYE OR SKIN CONTACT.
Other Precautions:STORAGE-IN SOLID FORM THIS MATERIAL POSES NO SPECIAL
    PROBLEMS. STORE METAL POWDER IN A DRY AREA AWAY FROM HEAT, IGNITION
    SOURCES AND INCOMPATIBLES. **SPILL-CLEANUP PERSONNEL SHOULD PROTECT
    AGAINST DUS T INHALATION & SKIN OR EYE CONTACT. USE NON-SPARKING
    TOOLS. PROPERLY LABEL ALL MATERIALS COLLECTED I N WASTE CONTAINER.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:USE NIOSH APPROVED RESPIRATORS AS SPECIFIED BY
    AN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENIST OR QUALIFIED SAFETY PROFESSIONAL. LUNG
    FUNCTIONS TESTS ARE RECOMMENDED FOR USERS OF NEGATIVE PRESSURE
    DEVICES. USE A FUME RESPIRA TOR OR AN AIR SUPPLIED RESPIRATOR WHERE
    LOCAL EXHAUST OR VENTILATION DOES NOT KEEP EXPOSURE BELOW THE OSHA
    LIMITS FOR AIR CONTAMINATION.
Ventilation:LOCAL EXHAUST VENTILATION SHOULD BE USED TO CONTROL
    EXPOSURE TO AIRBORNE DUST AND FUME EMISSIONS NEAR THE SOURCE BELOW
    THE EXPOSURE LIMITS CITED.
Protective Gloves:WEAR GLOVES TO PREVENT METAL CUTS & SKIN ABRASIONS.
Eye Protection:SAFETY GLASSES. (CONTACT LENSES SHOULD NOT BE WORN).
Other Protective Equipment:PROTECTIVE CLOTHING SUCH AS UNIFORMS,
    DISPOSABLE COVERALLS, SAFETY SHOES, ETC.
Work Hygienic Practices:PRACTICE GOOD PERSONAL HYGIENE AFTER HANDLING
    DUST OR POWDER FORMS OF THIS MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY BEFORE EATING,
    DRINKING, SMOKING OR APPLYING COSMETICS.
Supplemental Safety and Health
IF PRIOR DAMAGE OR DISEASE TO THE NEUROLOGIC (NERVOUS), CIRCULATORY,
    HEMATOLOGIC (BLOOD) OR RENAL (KIDNEY) SYSTEMS HAS OCCURRED, PROPER
    SCREENING OR EXAMINATIONS SHOULD BE CONDUCTED ON INDIVIDUALS WHO 
    MAY BE EXPOSED TO FURTHER RISK IF HANDLING AND USE OF THESE
    MATERIAL CAUSE EXCESSIVE EXPOSURE.
